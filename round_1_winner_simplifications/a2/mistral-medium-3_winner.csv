21-a2,"Your dreams can show you things you didn’t know you were thinking about. Many people have similar dreams, like flying, falling, losing teeth, or being naked in public. These dreams often mean the same thing for most people. But to really understand what they mean for you, think about what’s happening in your life and how you feel every day.",mistral-medium-3,descr,"Your dreams might show you all kinds of insights into things that you didn't realise you were thinking about. Common dreams like being able to fly or falling, your teeth falling out or having no clothes on in a public place probably mean something similar in most people. But the key to understanding exactly what they mean to you is to connect them to the events and feelings in your daily life."
22-a2,"One of the most interesting examples of wild animals living in cities is the wild dogs of Moscow. In Moscow, about 35,000 wild dogs live on the streets. Some of these dogs were born wild, while others were pets that people left behind. Some dogs live alone, and others live in groups.

In 2010, scientists studied these dogs and found that they have adapted very well to city life. They have learned that it is safer to cross the street with people, and some dogs even seem to understand traffic lights.",mistral-medium-3,descr,"One of the most interesting cases of wild animals living in a city are the wild dogs of Moscow.

23-a2,"""Wonder"" is the first book by RJ Palacio, who lives in New York. She says she got the idea for the story after seeing a girl with a different-looking face on the street. The book became very popular in the United States and has won many prizes. Schools are using it to talk about bullying, friendship, and how it feels to be different. A movie is being made from the book, and many people, including me, are excited to read more from RJ Palacio in the future.",mistral-medium-3,descr_ex,"Wonder is New Yorker RJ Palacio's first novel. On her website, she explains that the idea for the book came to her after seeing a girl with facial deformities on the street one day. Wonder has been a bestseller in the United States and has already won several awards. Many schools are using it as a starting point for discussions about bullying, friendship and what it's like to be different. A film version is being made, and many, including me, are waiting eagerly to see what RJ Palacio writes next."
24-a2,"Chloe has two pet rats named Zena and Roxy. She knows rats aren’t common pets, and she’s often tried to tell people that rats aren’t dirty. They can be great pets if you take good care of them. But she gets why some people don’t like them. She didn’t like rats either until her friend Martin showed her his pet rats. She saw how loving and smart they were. Last year, when one of Martin’s rats had babies, Chloe decided she wanted two of them.",mistral-medium-3,descr,"Chloe has two pet rats, Zena and Roxy.

Last year, when one of Martin's rats had babies, Chloe decided she'd like to have two of them."
25-a2,"Cape Town can be a dangerous place for baboons. Some have been hurt or killed in car crashes, and others have been shocked by electric wires. Baboons are in danger of disappearing, so the city wants to protect them and stop problems between people and baboons. The city has hired a team of Baboon Monitors to do this. Their job is to chase baboons away from the city or catch them and take them to the countryside. This has worked a little, but it is hard to keep baboons away from the city because they know they can find food there easily.",mistral-medium-3,descr_ex,"Cape Town can be a dangerous place for baboons. Some have been injured or killed in car accidents and others have been electrocuted as they played with electric cables. Baboons are an endangered species and to save them and minimise conflicts between humans and baboons, the city council has employed a team of Baboon Monitors. The monitors' job is to chase baboons out of urban areas or catch them and release them in the countryside. This policy has had some success, though it is proving hard to stop baboons from coming back to the city once they see it as a source of easy food."
26-a2,"I work for a big computer company, but their main office is in the USA. So, I do all my work from home on my computer. This is good because I don’t have to spend time going to an office or talking with coworkers. I work on different projects, and I like this because I can take time off when my kids need me, like for their school shows, or if I need to go to the dentist. The bad part is that because I don’t have set work hours, I often work late into the night. Sometimes I even skip dinner to finish my work.",mistral-medium-3,descr_ex,"I work for a global IT company, but because their headquarters is in the States, I do all my work online from home. That means that I don't waste time commuting or making idle chit-chat with colleagues. I work on a project basis, and this flexibility is very valuable to me because it means that I can easily take some time off when my children need me to go to their school performances or if I need to schedule an appointment with the dentist. The downside is that without clear office hours, I tend to work well into the evening, sometimes skipping dinner to finish a task. "
27-a2,"In the 1990s, graffiti was still popular, but street art also became very big all over the world. Some artists wanted to share political messages. They made art to make people think about war, unfairness, and treating people badly because of who they are. Other street artists just wanted to create beautiful, nice-looking art. In South America, many artists painted in poor areas. They added bright colors and life to dull, gray city walls.",mistral-medium-3,descr,"In the 1990s, graffiti continued but there was also an explosion in street art around the world. Some artists wanted to make political points and produced art that tried to make people think about war, inequality and discrimination.

In South America, many street artists went to work in poor areas adding colour, life and beauty to grey, city walls."
28-a2,"Every day, people see lots of ads on social media, in magazines, and in shop windows telling them to buy things. British people are buying more clothes and shoes than before.

Big brands sell clothes so cheaply that people treat them like things to throw away—wearing them just a few times and then getting rid of them.",mistral-medium-3,descr,"Social media, magazines and shop windows bombard people daily with things to buy, and British consumers are buying more clothes and shoes than ever before. Online shopping means it is easy for customers to buy without thinking, while major brands offer such cheap clothes that they can be treated like disposable items – worn two or three times and then thrown away."
29-a2,"Sam looked at the dust cloud made by the car driving up to the Big House. The horses moved and swished their tails to chase away flies. They didn’t care that their owner was visiting for the first time in ten months. Sam waited. Mr. Carter only came out when he had to, and that was fine with Sam. The less he saw his boss, the longer he would keep his job.

Mr. Carter wiped the sweat from his neck. The wet spots on his shirt looked like shapes on a map. His skin was already turning red from the June sun. But the rest of his skin was pale, like someone who stays inside and makes money while others do the work.",mistral-medium-3,descr,"Sam squinted against the sun at the distant dust trail raked up by the car on its way up to the Big House. The horses kicked and flicked their tails at flies, not caring about their owner's first visit in ten months. Sam waited. Mr Carter didn't come out here unless he had to, which was just fine by Sam. The more he kept out of his boss's way, the longer he'd have a job. Mr, Carter wiped the sweat from the back of his neck. The damp patches on his shirt drew together like shapes in an atlas. His skin was already turning ruddy in the June sun. Otherwise he had the indoor tan of a man that made money while other people did the work."
30-a2,"Many people in Berlin, Germany, were unhappy because hunters were shooting wild pigs. They thought it was too cruel. There were big arguments between hunters and people who love animals. Because of the protests, the city council chose a kinder way to deal with the pigs. Now, they are using fences and have made it against the law to feed the pigs. We will see if this works, but it might be hard because warmer winters mean there are more pigs than before.",mistral-medium-3,short,"Many city residents in Berlin, Germany complained that shooting pigs was unnecessarily cruel and there were heated arguments between hunters and animal lovers. In response to protests, the city council decided to take more peaceful action against pigs. Instead of shooting them, they have put up fences and made it illegal to feed the pigs. Time will tell if this strategy works, though it may be a losing battle as warmer winters mean that pig numbers are greater than in the past."
31-a2,"Suzanne Collins got the idea for *The Hunger Games* from her love of old Greek stories. When she was young, she really liked the story of *Theseus and the Minotaur*. In this story, Athens was controlled by Crete, but the people of Athens fought back. As punishment, the king of Crete made Athens send seven boys and seven girls to Crete every year. These young people were put into a big maze and eaten by a scary creature called the Minotaur. But one of them, Theseus, fought and killed the Minotaur. Suzanne sees Katniss Everdeen, the main character in *The Hunger Games*, as a future version of Theseus.",mistral-medium-3,descr,"An important inspiration for the Hunger Games book comes from Suzanne's love of classical Greek mythology. When she was a child, one of her favourite stories was Theseus and the Minotaur. In this story the city of Athens is ruled by Crete, but the Athenians rebel. As a punishment, Minos the king of Crete forces the Athenians to send seven boys and seven girls to Crete every year. The youths are thrown into the labyrinth and eaten by a monster that lives there called the Minotaur. But one of the youths, named Theseus, fights the Minotaur and kills it. Suzanne sees Katniss Everdeen as a futuristic Theseus."
32-a2,"Zoos help people learn about animals and why it’s important to protect them and their homes. They can also give a safe place to animals that were hurt in circuses or left by their owners. Zoos do important work, like studying how animals act and how to help them when they are sick.",mistral-medium-3,descr,"By bringing people and animals together, zoos have the potential to educate the public about conservation issues and inspire people to protect animals and their habitats. Some zoos provide a safe environment for animals which have been mistreated in circuses, or pets which have been abandoned. Zoos also carry out important research into subjects like animal behaviour and how to treat illnesses."
33-a2,"A new idea is growing against buying too much – the 'buy nothing' movement. It started in Canada in the early 1990s and then spread to the US. There, it became a way to say no to the big spending and shopping on Black Friday and Cyber Monday during Thanksgiving weekend. On Buy Nothing Day, people protest in different ways and even cut up their credit cards. All year, Buy Nothing groups help people swap or fix things they already have.",mistral-medium-3,descr,"A different trend is springing up in opposition to consumerism – the 'buy nothing' trend.

On Buy Nothing Day people organise various types of protests and cut up their credit cards. Throughout the year, Buy Nothing groups organise the exchange and repair of items they already own."
34-a2,"Is graffiti art or vandalism? It depends on how you see it. But in many places, painting or writing on public or private property is seen as vandalism.

35-a2,"What does the art world think about graffiti and street art? More people now see it as real art. Big cities like Paris, London, and Los Angeles have shown street art in galleries.

36-a2,"Most people have four to six dreams every night after they turn ten. That means about 2,000 dreams in one year. By the time someone is 80 years old, they might have had around 140,000 dreams. Even though we forget almost all of them—95 to 99 percent—we still remember a few thousand dreams in our lifetime.

It’s easy to see how a dream might seem to come true by chance. If the dream is about something that happens often in real life, it’s not surprising if something similar happens later.",mistral-medium-3,descr,"If most people have four to six dreams every night after the age of ten, that's as many as 2,000 dreams per year. So, by the time they reach 80 years old the average person might have had 140,000 dreams. Even if we forget 95–99 per cent of our dreams, that's still a few thousand remembered dreams across a lifetime. It's not too difficult to believe that, by coincidence, a dream event is followed by a real-life event that's similar to it, especially if the subject of the dream is something that happens often in everyday life."
37-a2,"*The Hunger Games* is set in the future after North America is destroyed. The new country is called Panem. It has twelve poor districts and one rich Capitol. The Capitol controls everything.

Because of this, many people in the city do not like them.",mistral-medium-3,short,"Often wild animals come into cities to look for food.

Baboons can be aggressive and have attacked a lot of pet animals, so understandably, many city residents don't welcome their presence."
39-a2,"Many bridge accidents happen while people are building the bridge. These accidents often happen because the engineers make a mistake, like a wrong calculation. The bridge can fall down because it is too heavy, and this can hurt or kill the workers who are on it at that time.",mistral-medium-3,descr_ex,"A large number of bridge accidents occur during the construction of the bridge itself.

40-a2,"George Lucas was one of the first movie directors to use the idea of the ""hero's journey"" in his stories. The hero's journey is a common story pattern with 17 parts. Usually, the hero starts by living a normal life, but then something happens that makes them go on an adventure and changes everything.

In *Star Wars*, Luke Skywalker lives a normal life with his aunt and uncle, fixing robots. But when he finds a message from Princess Leia to Obi-Wan Kenobi inside the robot R2D2, this is the moment that starts his big adventure.

41-a2,"One idea to stop a big rock from space that is coming to hit Earth is to break it apart with a nuclear bomb. This might sound like a movie, and it was in the 1998 film *Armageddon*, but it is a real plan from NASA. The plan is called HAMMER. It would use big rockets, each weighing eight tons, to push the rock off its path. If the rock is too close to Earth and there is no time to push it away, the rockets would carry nuclear bombs to destroy it instead.",mistral-medium-3,descr_ex,"Another suggested defence against a PHA on course to hit Earth is to blow it up using a nuclear weapon. It may sound like a plot from a film, and it was the subject of the 1998 film Armageddon, but the Hypervelocity Asteroid Mitigation Mission for Emergency Response (HAMMER) is a genuine NASA proposal. The eight-ton rockets would be fired at an approaching asteroid with the hope of bumping it off course. If the asteroid was too close to Earth for this plan to work, the rockets would carry nuclear bombs to blow it up instead."
42-a2,"At first, the hero doesn’t want to go on the adventure. But then a wise teacher comes to help them, and the hero decides to leave their normal life and enter a new, exciting world. There, the hero faces challenges, makes friends, and fights enemies to get ready for the biggest test. For example, in *Star Wars*, Luke’s teacher is Obi-Wan. His friends are Han Solo and the robots R2D2 and C3PO. His enemy is Darth Vader in the dangerous world of the Death Star.",mistral-medium-3,descr,"According to Campbell, the hero at first refuses the call to adventure, but a mentor appears who helps them and they decide to 'cross the threshold' and travel into the 'special world' where the adventure happens. The next stage consists of passing tests, fighting enemies and meeting friends as the hero prepares to face their biggest challenge. For Luke the mentor is, of course, Obi-Wan, the friends are Han Solo and the robots R2D2 and C3PO and the enemy is Darth Vader inside the special world of the Death Star."
43-a2,"Some people might think things they don’t use much are worthless, but others might find them useful. Thanks to the internet, online groups have found ways to make money by sharing these rarely used items. Websites and social media groups help people buy and sell used things, making it easy for people to share with each other. This is called the sharing economy.",mistral-medium-3,descr,"Underutilised items may seem useless to some, but could be an asset to others. With the advent of the internet, online communities have figured out a way to generate profit from the sharing of those underused assets.

And this is known as the sharing economy."
44-a2,"In the 1700s and 1800s, people had two main ideas about dreams. One idea was that dreams show things we don’t usually think about. A man named Freud thought that if we understand our dreams, we can learn about our hidden feelings and the problems they cause.

The other idea was very different. It said that dreams are just random thoughts and pictures in our brain while it sorts out memories from the day. When we wake up, we try to make these random thoughts and pictures into a story.",mistral-medium-3,descr,"Around the 18th and 19th centuries two main ideas about dreams became popular. One was the idea that the things we see in our dreams represent things hidden from our conscious mind. Freud believed that if we understand what dreams are telling us, we can understand our hidden feelings and the problems they cause. However, the other theory was the opposite. It said that dreams are just a collection of random activity in the brain while it's organising memories and events from the day. When we wake up, we try to make sense of these random images and feelings and put them into some sort of story."
45-a2,"I work for myself as a freelancer. This is good because I can choose what to do and how to use my time. At first, I worked from home, but it was hard to focus. There were too many things to distract me: chores to do, drinking tea, and my family asking for help. Then I tried working in a café near my home, but the internet was not good, and I drank too much coffee. Finally, I rented a desk in a shared office with five other freelancers.

46-a2,"NASA wants to find more middle-sized asteroids near Earth. To do this, they need money to build a special space telescope called NEOCam. This telescope would use infrared light to find these asteroids. If NASA gets the money, they could finish this work in about ten years.

These are the asteroids that could really hurt our planet if they hit it.",mistral-medium-3,descr_ex,"Whether NASA can find the remaining middle-sized NEOs depends on getting the money to build NEOCam, a 0.5-metre space telescope which would use infrared light to locate asteroids.

47-a2,"The ""buy nothing"" trend is now popular with social media stars who usually tell people to buy clothes and makeup. But now, some YouTube stars tell their fans not to buy anything for a whole year. Two friends in Canada tried this for a year and only bought food.

49-a2,"Some people believe that writing down your dreams can help you have lucid dreams. Lucid dreams are dreams where you know you are dreaming and can control what happens. For example, you might change a scary dream into a happy one, or decide what happens next, like a movie director. This way, you can create your dreams instead of just trying to understand them. But it’s also good to let some dreams happen naturally, so your mind can show you what it’s thinking.",mistral-medium-3,descr,"Some people think writing your dreams down can open your mind to lucid dreaming. Lucid dreams are dreams where you're not only aware you're dreaming but you can make decisions to affect the events of your dreams. So, maybe you can turn a nightmare into a safe-feeling dream, or you can direct the plot of your dream like a film director. Then, instead of just working out the meaning of your dreams, you'll be creating them, though you might want to continue having some dreams that allow your subconscious to tell you what's on your mind!

50-a2,"Many people don’t know they are part of the problem with throwaway clothes because they give their old clothes to charity shops. But these shops can’t sell all the clothes they get. ""Fast fashion"" is cheap, trendy clothing that quickly goes out of style and is often too badly made to be reused. People don’t want to buy it second-hand, so lots of it gets thrown away.

But charity shops can't sell all those unwanted clothes. 'Fast fashion' goes out of fashion as quickly as it came in and is often too poor quality to recycle; people don't want to buy it second-hand. Huge quantities end up being thrown away, and a lot of clothes that charities can't sell are sent abroad, causing even more economic and environmental problems."

Here, leaders act as coaches or mentors who encourage independent thought and expect to be challenged."
56-a2,"Gabriela noticed that she and her team had different ways of doing things. So, she decided to talk to them about how they felt about her leading them. Her team was happy she asked and told her honestly that they didn’t like being told exactly what to do. They preferred having the freedom to come up with their own ideas and make decisions.

85-a2,"One of the most important jobs of zoos today is helping animals that are in danger. Zoos work with other zoos around the world to help these animals have babies. In nature, some very rare animals have trouble finding a partner to have babies with. They also face dangers like people hunting them, losing their homes, and other animals attacking them. A good zoo gives these animals a safe place to live and have babies.

Another problem is that when there are very few animals left in the wild, they can become too similar to each other. This is not good for their health. Zoo breeding programs help by making sure there are enough different animals. Then, some of these animals can be set free in the wild to make the group stronger and healthier.",mistral-medium-3,descr_ex,"One of the most important modern functions of zoos is supporting international breeding programmes, particularly for endangered species. In the wild, some of the rarest species have difficulty in finding mates and breeding, and they might also be threatened by poachers, loss of their habitat and predators. A good zoo will enable these species to live and breed in a secure environment. In addition, as numbers of some wild species drop, there is an increased danger of populations becoming too genetically similar. Breeding programmes provide a safeguard: zoo-bred animals can be released into the wild to increase genetic diversity."

The amount of methane goes up and down during different times of the year, almost like the planet is breathing it in and out.",mistral-medium-3,descr,"The rover analyses the air around it periodically, and in 2014 it found the air contained another of the most basic organic molecules and a key ingredient of natural gas: methane. One of the characteristics of methane is that it only survives a few hundred years. This means that something, somewhere on Mars, is replenishing the supply. According to NASA, Mars emits thousands of tons of methane at a time. The level of methane rises and falls at seasonal intervals in the year, almost as if the planet is breathing it."
94-a2,"A long time ago, a psychologist named Carol Dweck from Stanford University worked with a group of ten-year-old children. She gave them some problems that were a little too hard for them. One group of children liked the challenge. They believed they could get better with practice and were excited about learning more in the future. Carol Dweck called this way of thinking a ""growth mindset.""

But another group of children felt bad. They thought the hard problems meant they were not smart enough. They believed they could not get better, no matter how hard they tried. Dweck called this a ""fixed mindset."" Some of these children even said they might cheat next time. Others tried to feel better by finding someone who did worse than them.",mistral-medium-3,descr,"Early in her career, the psychologist Carol Dweck of Stanford University gave a group of ten-year-olds problems that were slightly too hard for them. One group reacted positively, said they loved challenge and understood that their abilities could be developed. She says they had a 'growth mindset' and are focused on what they can achieve in the future. But another group of children felt that their intelligence was being judged and they had failed. They had a 'fixed mindset' and were unable to imagine improving. Some of these children said they might cheat in the future; others looked for someone who had done worse than them to boost their self-esteem."
95-a2,"Horror movies often use empty places. These can be old hospitals that no one uses anymore, scary empty houses, or towns where no one lives. There is something strange about these lonely, quiet places. What was it like when people lived there? Why did they go away? The silence can also be very scary. And in these places, you often can’t use your phone, which makes the story more believable. This is good for horror movie directors.",mistral-medium-3,descr_ex,"Horror films love uninhabited places. This could be an abandoned hospital, a scary empty house or a ghost town. There's something about lonely, empty places. What was it like when people lived there? Why did they leave? Maybe it's also that they are so quiet, which can be very scary too. Of course, abandoned places are also handy for horror film directors in that it's more believable that you will have no phone coverage there either."
96-a2,"In horror movies, basements are always scary, no matter what the house looks like. That’s where bad things hide, or where a crazy killer keeps their tools. Basements are dark and wet, and you have to go down a small, narrow set of stairs to get there. Even when nothing is there, basements still feel creepy.",mistral-medium-3,descr,"No matter what kind of house it is, the basement is a scary place in horror films. That's usually where something is hiding or where the evil psychopath has hidden their tools. Basements are always dark and often damp. You can only reach them by a narrow staircase. And basements are always creepy, even when there isn't anything down there."
97-a2,"Gary Collins was a policeman who was not working at the time. He was watching the London riots on TV. He saw some people he knew and decided to end his holiday early to help the police. He spent six months looking at CCTV videos and found 190 people, often just by looking at their eyes. His work was very important for the police. Even though there were 200,000 hours of video, the computer program that recognises faces only found one person.",mistral-medium-3,descr,"Gary Collins, an off-duty policeman, was watching the London riots on TV. He immediately recognised several people and cut his holiday short to help with identification. He ended up spending six months going through the CCTV film and managed to identify 190 people, many from their eyes alone. His help was of decisive importance in the investigation. Even with 200,000 hours of footage, facial recognition software managed to identify just one person."
98-a2,"I think it is very interesting to think about how we can make our bodies better to help us grow as humans. What if we could put a computer inside our brains? Soon, we might be able to do that. This could help us be better at math, see and hear things more clearly, and remember things better. More and more people will start to think this is normal.",mistral-medium-3,descr_ex,"Personally, I think it's fascinating to consider how we'll speed up our evolution as a species by augmenting our bodies. Imagine if you could implant a computer inside our brain! Soon we'll be able to do just that and enhance our mathematical ability, audiovisual perception and our memory, and this idea is only going to become more and more commonplace."
99-a2,"The talk was very interesting, and the speaker made some great points. For example, she talked about how parents influence their kids. How can we tell teenagers not to use their phones while doing homework if their parents are always on social media while cooking or driving? She also said something true about people trying to do many things at the same time. They switch between talking to people in real life and chatting online. I see this with my teenage daughter and her friends. They plan to meet, but then they sit together quietly while each one talks to someone else online.",mistral-medium-3,descr,"It was a fascinating talk and the speaker really hit the nail on the head with a couple of things. Take parental influence, for instance. How can we expect teenagers not to text while doing their homework when they witness their parents posting on social media while cooking the evening meal or waiting at a red light? She also made a valid point about people wanting to be in two or several places at once. So they switch back and forth between their real-life and online conversations. I see it all the time with my teenage daughter and her friends. They arrange to meet and then sit together in silence while each one engages in a different conversation online."
100-a2,"Some news stories make us think the world is getting more violent, but there are also reasons to be hopeful. Between the end of World War II and 1990, there were 30 wars where over 100,000 people died. Today, there are still civil wars, but most countries get along better than before. However, terrorism has increased in recent years, and since World War II, wars have killed more civilians than soldiers.

But even for civilians, the news isn’t all bad. People are nine times more likely to die from violent crime than from war, but the number of murders around the world has gone down a little. In 2000, about 8 out of every 100,000 people were murdered. By 2015, that number dropped to about 5.3.",mistral-medium-3,descr,"As for news stories that make us think the world is an increasingly violent place, there is cause for some optimism too. Between the end of World War II and 1990, there were 30 wars that killed more than 100,000 people. Today there are still civil wars, but countries are mostly co-existing more peacefully than in the past. However, terrorism has shot up in the last few years and, since World War II, wars have killed many more civilians than soldiers. Even for civilians, though, the statistics are not all bad. Although deaths are nine times more likely to be a result of violent crime than political conflict, the global murder rate fell slightly, from 8 per 100,000 people in 2000 to about 5.3 in 2015."
101-a2,"Wasfia has spent her life helping people and supporting human rights. She has worked on many projects in her home country to teach and train women and girls. But often, when these projects ended, the women were left with nothing.

Wasfia saw that Bangladesh needed to help itself. So, she combined two things she loves—climbing mountains and human rights—to try to change how people in her country think about women. She started climbing while working on projects in Tibet and Nepal. In Bangladesh, most people have never seen a mountain because the country is very flat.

Her work is making a difference. People in Bangladesh and around the world are starting to pay attention.",mistral-medium-3,descr_ex,"Wasfia has dedicated her life to supporting human rights and has witnessed numerous international humanitarian projects in her homeland to educate and train women and girls, but once too often they have been left with nothing when such projects have stopped running. Wasfia saw that Bangladesh needed to stand up for itself and so she brought together two of her passions, mountaineering and human rights, in order to try and change attitudes towards women in her country. She originally took up climbing while working on humanitarian campaigns in Tibet and Nepal, as in a coastal, primarily flat country like Bangladesh most people have never set eyes on a mountain. Her campaign seems to be doing the trick as fellow countrymen and women are sitting up and taking notice along with the rest of the world. "
102-a2,"Many people think that developing countries are in a very bad situation. They believe these countries are very poor, have bad leaders, and have little hope for change. But this is not true. In fact, things are getting much better. In the last 20 years, more than 700 million people have earned more money and are no longer poor. Also, six million fewer children die from sickness every year. More girls are going to school, and many more people now have clean water to drink.",mistral-medium-3,descr_ex,"The majority of people believe that developing countries are in a terrible situation: suffering from incredible poverty, governed by dictators and with little hope for any meaningful change. But, surprisingly, this is far from the truth. The reality is that a great transformation is occurring. Over the past 20 years, more than 700 million people have increased their income and come out of poverty. Additionally, six million fewer children die every year from disease, millions more girls are in school and millions of people have access to clean water."
103-a2,"Many managers try to make feedback more positive by putting negative comments between two good ones. But when this happens too often, workers might think the good comments are just there to make the bad ones seem better. This makes the good comments less meaningful. Instead, good feedback should not just be used to make bad feedback easier to take. It should be given to support and praise good work.",mistral-medium-3,descr,"In an attempt to inject some positivity into their feedback, many managers rely on sandwiching negative feedback between two positive comments. However, when feedback becomes such a routine, employees can start to perceive positive feedback as simply a form of sugarcoating the negatives, thus diminishing its value. Instead, positive feedback should not simply be seen as something to cushion the negative, but should be delivered so as to reinforce and encourage good performance."
104-a2,"I’m part of a group called the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots. Don’t think about scary movie robots crushing skulls. Think about what’s happening now: machines like drones and robot guns are already killing people with almost no human control. Soon, there could be robots that make their own decisions about who to kill. This seems very wrong and dangerous for all of us. We must be extremely careful about what we let machines do.",mistral-medium-3,descr,"I'm a member of the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots. Forget the movie image of a terrifying Terminator stamping on human skulls and think of what's happening right now: military machines like drones, gun turrets and sentry robots are already being used to kill with very little human input. The next step will be autonomous 'murderbots', following orders but ultimately deciding who to kill on their own. It seems clear to me that this would be completely unethical and dangerous for humanity. We need to be very cautious indeed about what we ask machines to do."

When you go into her office on Monday morning, she starts by saying you did a good job on the project. You wonder if this is just the nice part before the bad news, like in a ""feedback sandwich."" You know how it works—say something good, then say what’s really on your mind, then say something good again.",mistral-medium-3,descr,"Your manager stops you and says she needs to have a word about your performance in the recent project.

When you step into her office on Monday morning she begins by praising you for the good work you've done on the project, and you wonder if this is the obligatory praise that starts off the typical 'feedback sandwich'. You know how the feedback sandwich goes: say something nice, say what you really want to say, say something nice again."
107-a2,"The album *Born in the USA* has fast, exciting rock songs that make you want to dance. But the words in the songs are also very deep and full of feeling. Behind the fun music, there are sad stories about the hard parts of life in America. Many songs talk about regular people who work hard but still struggle. They feel angry and upset because life doesn’t give them money or fame.

For example, the song *Glory Days* is about people in a small town remembering when they were young and full of hope. *Downbound Train* tells the story of a young man whose life falls apart after he loses his job. It seems like the singer is writing about real people he knew and the life he might have had if he wasn’t famous.

This album shows just how talented the Boss really is.",mistral-medium-3,descr,"A fast-paced, foot-tapping rock album, Born in the USA's lyrics nevertheless carry emotional weight. Behind the catchy rock melodies that drive these powerhouse classics are stories of the dark side of the American dream. Many tracks deal with the struggles of hard-working ordinary people and the bitterness and anger they feel as life doesn't bring them riches or glory. The song Glory Days, for example, is about people in a small town looking back at when they were young and had the world at their feet while Downbound Train tells the story of a young man whose life is ruined when he loses his job. It's not hard to imagine that the artist is channelling real people he knew and the life he might have had if he hadn't become a star. The album will leave you in no doubt of the unique and extraordinary talent of the Boss."

On his trips, Lewis has seen this damage himself. He has swum over coral reefs that are white because the water is too warm. He has also seen empty areas under the Red Sea with no life, just plastic trash.

Lewis believes nature can heal if we give it space, but we must act fast. If we don’t take care of the seas now, the problem could become too big to solve.",mistral-medium-3,short,"Lewis would like to see the number of marine protected areas in the world increase from 3 per cent to 10 per cent in an attempt to reverse the damage caused by human activity such as overfishing, polluting and littering. During his expeditions, Lewis has witnessed this environmental destruction first-hand. He's swum over coral reefs bleached by the increase in water temperature, and observed underwater deserts beneath the shallow waters of the Red Sea, devoid of life and strewn with plastic. Pugh believes that nature can recover if it is given space to do so, but the clock is ticking. If we don't start looking after our seas, we may soon have an unsolvable problem on our hands."

We are living longer, healthier, freer, and happier lives. The real problem, Pinker says, is that the ideas of reason and science from the Enlightenment are being attacked.

111-a2,"In old scary movies, when the main characters were in big trouble, they couldn’t call for help or call the police. It was hard or even impossible. Now, because of mobile phones, that doesn’t seem real anymore. So, how do movies keep the scary feeling? No phone signal! If you’re the hero in a scary movie, you can be sure that at the worst moment, when you really need to call for help, your phone won’t work. Or your phone battery will die just as you try to call. Or both things will happen.",mistral-medium-3,descr,"In older horror films, when protagonists were in desperation, it was difficult or impossible for them to call for help or call the police.

112-a2,"In the 1950s, banana companies in Central America had a big problem. Their most popular banana, called the Gros Michel or ""Big Mike,"" was dying. Now, the same thing is happening to the Cavendish banana, which replaced the Gros Michel.

The Gros Michel banana was very popular because it was easy to transport, had thick skin, and tasted sweet. It grew on many farms in Central America. The main company that grew and sold bananas at that time was United Fruit. They made bananas in a fast way: instead of growing new plants from seeds, they took parts from old plants and grew them in big, crowded fields.",mistral-medium-3,descr_ex,"In the 1950s, Central American commercial banana growers were facing the death of their most lucrative product, the Gros Michel banana, known as Big Mike. And now it's happening again to Big Mike's successor – the Cavendish. With its easily transported, thick-skinned and sweet-tasting fruit, the Gros Michel banana plant dominated the plantations of Central America. United Fruit, the main grower and exporter in South America at the time, mass-produced its bananas in the most efficient way possible: it cloned shoots from the stems of plants instead of growing plants from seeds, and cultivated them in densely packed fields."
113-a2,"Most spiders have venom to catch their food, not to hurt people. Only 25 types of spiders can really harm humans with their venom. Even though spider bites can hurt, they are almost never deadly. For example, Australia’s dangerous Sydney funnel-web spider hasn’t killed anyone since 1981, when a special medicine was made to treat its bites.

But be careful with hairy spiders like tarantulas. If they feel scared, they can shoot out tiny, annoying hairs. These hairs stick to your skin or eyes and cause pain.",mistral-medium-3,descr,"Spider venom is present in most species and serves the purpose of stunning or killing their prey rather than attacking humans. In fact, only 25 of the known spider species produce venom which can actually harm humans, and although spider bites can be painful, they are rarely deadly. Australia's notorious Sydney funnel-web spider has not produced any fatalities since anti-venom was developed in 1981. However, take care not to rub hairy spiders like tarantulas up the wrong way. When they feel in danger, they defend themselves by ejecting a cloud of urticating hairs. These irritating hairs then embed themselves in the skin or eyes of the attacker."
114-a2,"This scary movie idea was very common in horror films from the late 1900s. It begins with a group of young people having fun, and it ends with all of them dead except one girl. At the start, the girl is usually quiet, shy, and not very strong. But by the end, she becomes the bravest and smartest person there. The last girl almost always survives in the end.",mistral-medium-3,descr,"This horror film cliché was especially popular with horror films of the late 20th century. It starts with a group of teenagers all enjoying themselves, and it ends with everyone dead except one girl. At the beginning the girl is usually innocent, shy and not particularly strong. By the end, she has become the toughest and most resourceful person in the world. The last girl almost always wins in the end."
115-a2,"To understand how humans developed the ability to use complex language, we need to look at how our brains are different from other animals. It’s not just about the size of the brain—it’s also about what the brain can do and how it changed over time. However, there isn’t much physical evidence to help us. Things left behind by our ancestors don’t show us what kind of speech they could make.

One thing we can see from early human remains is how their mouths, throats, and tongues developed. By about 100,000 years ago, humans could make complex sounds. Before that, scientists can only guess if early humans used simpler sounds to communicate.",mistral-medium-3,descr,"If we want to know where our capability for complex language came from, we need to look at how our brains are different from other animals. This relates to more than just brain size; it is important what other things our brains can do and when and why they evolved that way. And for this there are very few physical clues; artefacts left by our ancestors don't tell us what speech they were capable of making. One thing we can see in the remains of early humans, however, is the development of the mouth, throat and tongue. By about 100,000 years ago, humans had evolved the ability to create complex sounds. Before that, evolutionary biologists can only guess whether or not early humans communicated using more basic sounds."
116-a2,"People often say that girls should like art and books, while boys should do math and science. This idea comes from society, not nature. Also, young people don’t see many women working in science jobs. In cartoons and stories, scientists, inventors, or astronauts are usually men. Many people think scientists are strange, not good at talking to others, or that they work alone. These ideas are not true, but they make girls think science is not for them. If girls saw more women doing science jobs, they would feel more confident and think science is a good choice for them.",mistral-medium-3,descr,"It is society, not nature, that tells us girls should favour arts and humanities and leave maths and physics to the boys. Coupled with this is the lack of positive female role models youngsters see doing science-related jobs. Cartoons and stories often show the crazy scientist, genius inventor, or adventurous astronaut as a man. Furthermore, there is an unfortunate perception that scientists are geeky, have poor social skills or that their work is lonely and detached from the rest of the world. These are false stereotypes portrayed by the media, but they may mean that girls do not identify with scientists, and see science as an unappealing career path. If girls saw more positive female role models in science it would give them more confidence and a greater sense of belonging in those subjects."

A survey shows that students and staff like the newspaper because it is fun, teaches them about culture, and gives them work experience.

Printing the newspaper costs a lot of money. Also, some students cannot get it easily because they have to go to the university to pick it up. Another problem is that many copies are left on the ground as trash, which is bad for the environment.",mistral-medium-3,descr_ex,"The Scallion is printed weekly and distributed free in faculty buildings, with a readership of approximately 10,000 students. It is written and produced entirely by students. The survey shows that the newspaper is highly valued by university students and staff for entertainment, cultural enrichment and work experience.

119-a2,"I really agree with what the speaker said. I think there’s a problem—when we’re always connected to others, we can feel more alone. This isn’t such a big issue for my age group because we grew up without so much technology. We know how to be by ourselves, and we understand that it’s fine to be alone. But young people under 20 are different. They spend so much time messaging others that they never really feel what it’s like to be alone. Because of this, they might never learn to enjoy their own company. Also, they learn to talk through messages that can be edited, which means they might not learn how to have real conversations face-to-face with someone.",mistral-medium-3,descr,"So much of what the speaker said rang true. I honestly believe there's a danger that the more connected we are, the more isolated we feel. I don't think this is such an issue for my generation who've lived without technology for so long. We know how to be alone and, more importantly, we know that it's OK to be alone. But the under 20s are another kettle of fish. They're so busy communicating that they never experience the feeling of solitude and run the risk of not learning how to enjoy their own company. In addition, they're learning conversation through messages that can be edited and changed at the expense of learning the art of real conversation in real time with the person in front of you."
120-a2,"Don’t always give negative feedback right after positive feedback. If you always mix good and bad comments together, the good ones might seem less important and get ignored. Sometimes, just give praise without adding any criticism. Try not to always point out what could be better.",mistral-medium-3,descr,"Don't always follow positive feedback with negative feedback. When positive and negative feedback always appear to go hand in hand, the positives can become devalued and ignored. Ensure there are times when positive feedback is given for its own sake and resist the temptation to offer constructive criticism."
