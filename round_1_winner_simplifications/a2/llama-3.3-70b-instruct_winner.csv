21-a2,"Your dreams can show you things you didn't know you were thinking about. Some people have similar dreams, like flying, falling, losing teeth or being naked in public. These dreams probably mean similar things to many people. But to understand what they mean to you, you need to think about what's happening in your life and how you're feeling. This can help you connect your dreams to your daily life and understand them better.",llama-3.3-70b-instruct,descr_ex,"Your dreams might show you all kinds of insights into things that you didn't realise you were thinking about. Common dreams like being able to fly or falling, your teeth falling out or having no clothes on in a public place probably mean something similar in most people. But the key to understanding exactly what they mean to you is to connect them to the events and feelings in your daily life."

Some dogs live alone, and some live in groups. Scientists studied the dogs in 2010. They found that the dogs are very good at living in the city. The dogs have learned to cross the street with people, and some even understand traffic lights.",llama-3.3-70b-instruct,short,"One of the most interesting cases of wild animals living in a city are the wild dogs of Moscow.

They have learned that it is safer to cross the street with people and some dogs appear to understand traffic lights."
23-a2,"RJ Palacio from New York wrote a book called Wonder. It's her first book. She got the idea for the book when she saw a girl on the street who looked different. The girl had a face that wasn't like most people's. Wonder is a very popular book in the US and has won some awards. Many schools are reading it and talking about important issues like being mean to others, having friends, and being different. A movie is being made from the book, and many people, including me, want to read her next book.",llama-3.3-70b-instruct,descr,"Wonder is New Yorker RJ Palacio's first novel.

A film version is being made, and many, including me, are waiting eagerly to see what RJ Palacio writes next."

Baboons are in danger, so the city wants to help them. The city also wants to stop problems between people and baboons. To do this, they have a team of people called Baboon Monitors.

The monitors' job is to chase baboons out of urban areas or catch them and release them in the countryside.

This is good because I don't lose time traveling to work or talking to colleagues about things that are not important. I work on different projects, and I like that I can choose when I work.

Some artists wanted to talk about important issues like war, unfairness, and treating people differently. They made art to make people think about these problems.

The city leaders listened to the complaints and decided to try a kinder way to deal with the pigs. Instead of killing them, they built fences and made a rule that people cannot feed the pigs.

When we're awake, we think with words, like when we talk to ourselves.

This also hurts the environment because many copies are thrown away on campus and make a mess.",llama-3.3-70b-instruct,descr,"The Scallion is printed weekly and distributed free in faculty buildings, with a readership of approximately 10,000 students. It is written and produced entirely by students. The survey shows that the newspaper is highly valued by university students and staff for entertainment, cultural enrichment and work experience. The cost of printing newspapers is significant. Furthermore, some students do not have easy access to the paper, since the only way to obtain a copy is to physically go to university. An additional environmental issue is that a large number of copies end up as litter on campus."

The main goal of this report is to find out why employees are not happy with their jobs and to suggest ways to make the workplace better, so more employees want to stay.",llama-3.3-70b-instruct,descr,"At Girox Foods, we are experiencing an annual employee turnover of about 12 per cent. Although this might not seem high at first glance, the industry standard is seven per cent. The principal objective of this report is to investigate the causes of employee engagement within the firm and, based on those, offer recommendations to improve the employees' experience of the workplace and increase employee retention."
119-a2,"I think the speaker made some good points. I really believe that the more we're connected to our phones and computers, the more alone we can feel. I don't think this is a big problem for people my age who didn't grow up with technology. We're used to being alone and we know it's okay to have time to ourselves. But for people under 20, it's different. They're always messaging and never really get to experience being alone. This means they might not learn how to be happy with just themselves. Also, they're learning how to talk to people by sending messages that they can change before sending. This means they might not learn how to have real conversations with people face to face.",llama-3.3-70b-instruct,descr,"So much of what the speaker said rang true. I honestly believe there's a danger that the more connected we are, the more isolated we feel. I don't think this is such an issue for my generation who've lived without technology for so long. We know how to be alone and, more importantly, we know that it's OK to be alone. But the under 20s are another kettle of fish. They're so busy communicating that they never experience the feeling of solitude and run the risk of not learning how to enjoy their own company. In addition, they're learning conversation through messages that can be edited and changed at the expense of learning the art of real conversation in real time with the person in front of you."
120-a2,"When you give good feedback, don't always give bad feedback at the same time. If you always do this, people might not care about the good feedback. Sometimes, just give good feedback because it's good. Don't feel like you have to say something bad as well. This means ""constructive criticism"" - it's when you tell someone how they can improve. Try not to do this every time you say something good.",llama-3.3-70b-instruct,descr_ex,"Don't always follow positive feedback with negative feedback. When positive and negative feedback always appear to go hand in hand, the positives can become devalued and ignored. Ensure there are times when positive feedback is given for its own sake and resist the temptation to offer constructive criticism."
