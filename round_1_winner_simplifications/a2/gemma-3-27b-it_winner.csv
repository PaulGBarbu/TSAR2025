Wild dogs in Moscow are a very interesting example of animals living in a city. There are about 35,000 wild dogs living in the streets of Moscow. Some of these dogs were born in the wild, but others used to have owners who left them. Some dogs live by themselves, and others live in groups called packs. In 2010, scientists studied these dogs and discovered they have adapted very well to living in the city. They have learned it’s safer to walk across the road with people, and some dogs even seem to know what traffic lights mean.",gemma-3-27b-it,descr_ex,"One of the most interesting cases of wild animals living in a city are the wild dogs of Moscow.

People living in Berlin, Germany were upset because the city was killing wild pigs with guns, and they thought this was very cruel. Hunters and people who love animals argued about it. 

Because people protested, the city government decided to try a kinder way to deal with the pigs. Now, instead of shooting them, they are building fences to keep the pigs in certain areas. It is also now against the law to give the pigs food.

Suzanne Collins, the writer of *The Hunger Games*, got a big idea from old Greek stories. When she was young, she loved the story of Theseus and the Minotaur.

In this story, the city of Athens was controlled by Crete, but the people of Athens fought back. As a punishment, the king of Crete, Minos, made Athens send seven boys and seven girls to Crete each year. These young people were put in a confusing maze called a labyrinth, where a monster called the Minotaur would eat them. 

But a young man named Theseus fought the Minotaur and won. Suzanne Collins thinks of Katniss Everdeen, the main character in *The Hunger Games*, as being like Theseus, but in the future.

Most people have four to six dreams each night after they are ten years old. That means they can have up to 2,000 dreams every year. By the time someone is 80 years old, they might have had 140,000 dreams!

Even though we forget most of our dreams – usually 95 to 99 out of every 100 – we still remember a few thousand dreams in our life. It’s not surprising that sometimes something in a dream happens later in real life. This is especially true if the dream is about something that often happens to us when we are awake.

One idea to protect Earth from a big space rock heading towards us is to use a nuclear bomb to destroy it. It sounds like something from a movie – like the film *Armageddon* from 1998 – but NASA actually suggested this in a real plan called HAMMER.

Next, the hero has to pass tests, fight bad guys, and meet people who will help them. This gets them ready for their biggest challenge. For example, in Star Wars, Obi-Wan is Luke’s mentor.

Between the 1700s and 1800s, people started to have two main ideas about dreams. One idea was that dreams show things we don’t fully know about ourselves – feelings and thoughts we hide even from ourselves. A doctor named Freud thought that by understanding our dreams, we could understand these hidden feelings and why they cause problems. 

But another idea was different. It said dreams are just what happens when your brain sorts out memories and things that happened during the day. It’s like your brain is busy tidying up! When you wake up, you try to make a story from the strange pictures and feelings you had while dreaming.

It said that dreams are just a collection of random activity in the brain while it's organising memories and events from the day. When we wake up, we try to make sense of these random images and feelings and put them into some sort of story."

Many people don’t know they are part of the problem with clothes we throw away, even if they give their old clothes to charity.

In some towns, local governments have tried to help artists paint without causing trouble. They do this by letting artists paint in special areas. Taiwan is one of these places – they have areas called ‘graffiti zones’ where artists can paint on walls freely. In São Paulo, Brazil, the city government has even allowed artists to paint on some subway trains.

Faith47 is from Cape Town, which is a city in South Africa. She makes large, bright paintings of people and animals, and she loves to paint in different places. You can find her art on streets, in old, empty buildings, and even on cars that people don’t use anymore. 

She likes that most street art doesn’t stay for long. Rain or people who clean the city will often remove it. She thinks this is like life – things change all the time, and everything has an end and a new start.

Gabriela used to work in a place where people thought it was very important to respect bosses and people in charge. Everyone knew their role, and leaders made most of the decisions – people didn’t usually question them.

Firstly, many people are buying clothes using credit cards. People in the UK owe about £670 each to credit card companies. That’s almost two-thirds of the money they spend on clothes each year. Also, people are spending money they don’t have to buy things they don’t really need.

Today, zoos are very important for helping to save animals that are in danger. They do this by helping animals have babies, especially rare ones.

Sometimes, it’s hard for these rare animals to find partners and have babies in the wild. Also, people who hunt illegally (called **poachers**), losing their homes (**habitat**), and other animals that hunt them (**predators**) can all cause problems. 

A good zoo keeps these animals safe so they can live and have families. 

When there are very few of a type of animal left, they can become too similar to each other. This isn’t healthy. So, zoos help by breeding animals and then releasing them back into the wild. This helps make sure there’s a wider mix of genes, which is better for the animals’ future.



",gemma-3-27b-it,descr,"One of the most important modern functions of zoos is supporting international breeding programmes, particularly for endangered species. In the wild, some of the rarest species have difficulty in finding mates and breeding, and they might also be threatened by poachers, loss of their habitat and predators. A good zoo will enable these species to live and breed in a secure environment. In addition, as numbers of some wild species drop, there is an increased danger of populations becoming too genetically similar. Breeding programmes provide a safeguard: zoo-bred animals can be released into the wild to increase genetic diversity."
86-a2,"These accidents almost never happen, but boats and trains can both cause a bridge to fall down – and for different reasons.

Trains are dangerous because of how fast they are going when they hit a bridge. Boats are dangerous because they are very heavy. Even if a boat isn’t going fast, its weight can make a bridge fall. 

The best way to stop these accidents is to be prepared. We can use new technology to find problems with bridges before they happen. Making sure workers are safe and designing bridges better can also help to prevent these awful accidents.

Modern technologies that can detect structural weakness, safer working environments and better designs can all help to reduce these terrible accidents."

Dreams might happen because our brain sorts out what we think about during the day. But in dreams, these thoughts often appear as symbols – things that represent other things. When we are awake, we usually think using words, like when we talk to ourselves in our head. But when we sleep, the part of the brain that helps us with language doesn’t work as much. Instead, the part of the brain that controls our feelings becomes more active.

Having good relationships with people is very important for happiness. A study showed that most happy people have close friends and family, and they see them often. It’s also important to have at least one person you can really talk to about your feelings – sharing your thoughts and feelings is called ‘self-disclosure’. Just one close friend is enough, along with other friends too. It’s not enough to just have friends to do activities with, or to talk about things like music or sports.

Lots of people praise others for being clever or talented, like saying “You are very good at noticing small things” or “You are a natural at planning parties”. But studies show it’s better to praise *how* someone does something.

When Carol Dweck, a psychologist from Stanford University, started her work, she gave some ten-year-old children puzzles that were a little difficult. Some children were happy about the challenge. They said they enjoyed trying hard and believed they could get better at things. Dr. Dweck called this a ‘growth mindset’ – meaning they think about what they can learn and do in the future. 

But other children got upset. They thought the puzzles were testing how smart they were, and they felt like they had failed. Dr. Dweck called this a ‘fixed mindset’ – meaning they believed they couldn’t really improve. Some of these children said they might try to copy others’ answers.

At first, this girl is often quiet, a little scared, and not very strong. But by the end, she becomes very brave and clever – the strongest person there. This last girl almost always survives.",gemma-3-27b-it,descr,"This horror film cliché was especially popular with horror films of the late 20th century. It starts with a group of teenagers all enjoying themselves, and it ends with everyone dead except one girl. At the beginning the girl is usually innocent, shy and not particularly strong. By the end, she has become the toughest and most resourceful person in the world. The last girl almost always wins in the end."
115-a2,"If we want to understand how we learned to use complicated language, we need to look at how our brains are different from those of other animals. It’s not just about the size of the brain, but also what our brains can do, and when and why these abilities developed. It’s hard to find proof of this – old objects left by people who lived long ago don’t tell us about their speech. However, we can look at the remains of early humans and see how their mouths, throats, and tongues changed over time. Around 100,000 years ago, humans could make many different sounds. Before that time, scientists who study evolution can only make guesses about how early humans communicated – if they used simple sounds or not.",gemma-3-27b-it,descr_ex,"If we want to know where our capability for complex language came from, we need to look at how our brains are different from other animals. This relates to more than just brain size; it is important what other things our brains can do and when and why they evolved that way. And for this there are very few physical clues; artefacts left by our ancestors don't tell us what speech they were capable of making. One thing we can see in the remains of early humans, however, is the development of the mouth, throat and tongue. By about 100,000 years ago, humans had evolved the ability to create complex sounds. Before that, evolutionary biologists can only guess whether or not early humans communicated using more basic sounds."

It’s not natural for girls to prefer subjects like art and literature – society teaches them to. People often think boys are better at subjects like maths and science. Also, young people don’t often see women working in science jobs. 

Often, in cartoons and stories, scientists, inventors, and astronauts are shown as men. Also, some people unfortunately think scientists are strange, not very good with people, or work alone. These ideas aren’t true, and the media often shows them this way. But these ideas might make girls think science isn’t for them, and they might not want to be scientists.

If girls had more examples of successful women in science, they would feel more confident and like they belong in those subjects. 

**(Role models are people who show others what’s possible. Stereotypes are simple ideas about groups of people that aren’t always true.)**



",gemma-3-27b-it,descr,"It is society, not nature, that tells us girls should favour arts and humanities and leave maths and physics to the boys. Coupled with this is the lack of positive female role models youngsters see doing science-related jobs. Cartoons and stories often show the crazy scientist, genius inventor, or adventurous astronaut as a man. Furthermore, there is an unfortunate perception that scientists are geeky, have poor social skills or that their work is lonely and detached from the rest of the world. These are false stereotypes portrayed by the media, but they may mean that girls do not identify with scientists, and see science as an unappealing career path. If girls saw more positive female role models in science it would give them more confidence and a greater sense of belonging in those subjects."
117-a2,"The Scallion is a student newspaper that comes out every week. It’s given away for free in university buildings, and about 10,000 students read it. Students write and make the newspaper completely by themselves.

A recent study shows students and staff really like the newspaper. They enjoy it for fun, to learn about different things, and to get experience for jobs. 

However, printing the newspaper costs a lot of money. Also, not all students can easily get a copy, because they have to go to university to pick one up. Another problem is that many newspapers are thrown away on campus as rubbish, which is bad for the environment.



",gemma-3-27b-it,descr,"The Scallion is printed weekly and distributed free in faculty buildings, with a readership of approximately 10,000 students. It is written and produced entirely by students. The survey shows that the newspaper is highly valued by university students and staff for entertainment, cultural enrichment and work experience. The cost of printing newspapers is significant. Furthermore, some students do not have easy access to the paper, since the only way to obtain a copy is to physically go to university. An additional environmental issue is that a large number of copies end up as litter on campus."

At Girox Foods, about 12 out of every 100 workers leave each year. This might not sound like a lot, but most companies in our business only lose 7 out of 100. This report looks at why our workers are leaving and what we can do to make things better for them. We want to find ways to keep our workers happy at their jobs and encourage them to stay with the company. 

*(‘Turnover’ means the rate at which employees leave a company and are replaced. ‘Retention’ means keeping employees working at a company for a long time.)*



",gemma-3-27b-it,descr,"At Girox Foods, we are experiencing an annual employee turnover of about 12 per cent. Although this might not seem high at first glance, the industry standard is seven per cent. The principal objective of this report is to investigate the causes of employee engagement within the firm and, based on those, offer recommendations to improve the employees' experience of the workplace and increase employee retention."

What the speaker said felt very true. I really think that when we are always in touch with people, we can also feel lonely. I don’t think this is a big problem for people my age, because we grew up without always having phones and the internet. We know how to be by ourselves, and we know that’s okay. But younger people, under 20, are different. They are always talking to people, so they don’t often feel alone. They might not learn how to enjoy being with themselves. Also, they are learning to talk by sending messages. You can change these messages before you send them. This is different from talking to someone face to face, where you have to think quickly and say what you mean right away.",gemma-3-27b-it,descr_ex,"So much of what the speaker said rang true. I honestly believe there's a danger that the more connected we are, the more isolated we feel. I don't think this is such an issue for my generation who've lived without technology for so long. We know how to be alone and, more importantly, we know that it's OK to be alone. But the under 20s are another kettle of fish. They're so busy communicating that they never experience the feeling of solitude and run the risk of not learning how to enjoy their own company. In addition, they're learning conversation through messages that can be edited and changed at the expense of learning the art of real conversation in real time with the person in front of you."

Don’t always say something good and then something bad. If you always give a good comment followed by a bad one, people might stop noticing the good things. Make sure to sometimes say something good without needing to also say something to improve. Try not to always point out what someone could do better.



",gemma-3-27b-it,descr,"Don't always follow positive feedback with negative feedback. When positive and negative feedback always appear to go hand in hand, the positives can become devalued and ignored. Ensure there are times when positive feedback is given for its own sake and resist the temptation to offer constructive criticism."
