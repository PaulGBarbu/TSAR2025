21-a2,"Your dreams might show you thoughts you didn’t know you had. Dreams like flying, falling, losing your teeth, or being in public without clothes often mean something similar for many people. But to understand what they mean for you, think about what’s happening in your life and how you feel.",qwen3-235b-a22b-2507,descr,"Your dreams might show you all kinds of insights into things that you didn't realise you were thinking about. Common dreams like being able to fly or falling, your teeth falling out or having no clothes on in a public place probably mean something similar in most people. But the key to understanding exactly what they mean to you is to connect them to the events and feelings in your daily life."
22-a2,"One of the most interesting examples of wild animals living in a city is the wild dogs of Moscow. In Moscow, about 35,000 wild dogs live on the streets. Some of these dogs were born in the wild, and others are pets that their owners left behind. Some dogs live alone, while others live in groups called packs. In 2010, scientists studied these dogs and found that they have adapted very well to city life. They have learned that it is safer to cross the street when people are crossing, and some dogs even seem to understand traffic lights.",qwen3-235b-a22b-2507,descr_ex,"One of the most interesting cases of wild animals living in a city are the wild dogs of Moscow.

24-a2,"Chloe has two pet rats named Zena and Roxy. She knows rats are not common pets, and she’s lost count of how many times she’s had to explain to people that rats aren’t dirty. She tells them that rats can be great pets if you take good care of them. But she also understands why some people don’t like rats — she didn’t like them either, at first. Then her friend Martin showed her his pet rats. She saw how smart and loving they were, and that changed her mind. Last year, when one of Martin’s rats had babies, Chloe decided she wanted two of them for herself.",qwen3-235b-a22b-2507,descr,"Chloe has two pet rats, Zena and Roxy.

25-a2,"Cape Town can be a dangerous place for baboons. Some have been hurt or killed by cars, and others have died after touching electric wires while playing. Baboons are at risk of disappearing, so the city has hired Baboon Monitors to help protect them. These monitors try to keep baboons out of towns by chasing them away or catching them and taking them back to the wild. This has helped a bit, but it’s hard to stop baboons from returning to the city when they know they can find easy food there.",qwen3-235b-a22b-2507,descr,"Cape Town can be a dangerous place for baboons. Some have been injured or killed in car accidents and others have been electrocuted as they played with electric cables. Baboons are an endangered species and to save them and minimise conflicts between humans and baboons, the city council has employed a team of Baboon Monitors. The monitors' job is to chase baboons out of urban areas or catch them and release them in the countryside. This policy has had some success, though it is proving hard to stop baboons from coming back to the city once they see it as a source of easy food."
26-a2,"I work for a big international IT company. Their main office is in the United States, so I do all my work from home using the internet. This means I don’t have to travel to work or spend time talking casually with coworkers. I work on one project at a time, and I like this because it gives me freedom. If my kids have a school event or I need to see the dentist, I can take time off easily. The bad side is that since I don’t have fixed working hours, I often keep working late into the night. Sometimes I even miss dinner to finish a job.",qwen3-235b-a22b-2507,descr,"I work for a global IT company, but because their headquarters is in the States, I do all my work online from home. That means that I don't waste time commuting or making idle chit-chat with colleagues. I work on a project basis, and this flexibility is very valuable to me because it means that I can easily take some time off when my children need me to go to their school performances or if I need to schedule an appointment with the dentist. The downside is that without clear office hours, I tend to work well into the evening, sometimes skipping dinner to finish a task. "
27-a2,"In the 1990s, graffiti kept going, but street art also grew fast around the world. Some artists wanted to share political messages and made art to make people think about war, unfair treatment, and inequality. Others wanted to create beautiful and eye-catching pieces. In South America, many street artists painted in poor neighborhoods, bringing color, energy, and beauty to dull city walls.",qwen3-235b-a22b-2507,descr,"In the 1990s, graffiti continued but there was also an explosion in street art around the world.

Mr. Carter didn’t come out here unless he had to—and that suited Sam just fine. The less he saw of his boss, the safer his job. Mr. Carter wiped sweat from his neck.

30-a2,"Many people in Berlin, Germany said killing wild pigs was too cruel. This caused strong arguments between hunters and people who care about animals. Because of the complaints, the city decided to try a calmer way to deal with the pigs. Instead of shooting them, they built fences and made it against the law to feed the pigs. It’s not yet clear if this will work. But it could be hard to stop the pigs from spreading, especially because warmer winters help them grow in number.",qwen3-235b-a22b-2507,descr,"Many city residents in Berlin, Germany complained that shooting pigs was unnecessarily cruel and there were heated arguments between hunters and animal lovers. In response to protests, the city council decided to take more peaceful action against pigs. Instead of shooting them, they have put up fences and made it illegal to feed the pigs. Time will tell if this strategy works, though it may be a losing battle as warmer winters mean that pig numbers are greater than in the past."
31-a2,"One big idea for the Hunger Games book comes from Suzanne Collins’s love of old Greek stories. When she was young, her favorite story was Theseus and the Minotaur. In this tale, the city of Athens is ruled by Crete, but the people of Athens fight back. As punishment, King Minos of Crete makes Athens send seven boys and seven girls every year. These young people are put into a maze called the labyrinth, where a monster named the Minotaur lives and kills them. But one boy, Theseus, bravely fights the Minotaur and kills it.

33-a2,"A new trend is growing against consumerism – the 'buy nothing' trend. It started in Canada in the early 1990s and then spread to the US. There, it became a way to say no to spending too much money and buying too many things, especially on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, which happen during Thanksgiving weekend. On Buy Nothing Day, people hold protests and sometimes cut up their credit cards.

36-a2,"Most people have four to six dreams every night after age ten. That’s about 2,000 dreams a year. By age 80, the average person may have had 140,000 dreams. Even though we forget 95 to 99 out of every 100 dreams, we still remember a few thousand in our lives.

41-a2,"Another idea to stop a big space rock (called a PHA) from hitting Earth is to destroy it with a nuclear bomb. It sounds like a movie story — and it was the plot of the 1998 film *Armageddon* — but it’s also part of a real plan from NASA called HAMMER, which stands for Hypervelocity Asteroid Mitigation Mission for Emergency Response.

That’s why dreams feel so emotional and strange.",qwen3-235b-a22b-2507,descr_ex,"Maybe dreams are the result of our mind organising the thoughts we have during the day, but they appear in dreams with symbolic meaning.

However, research suggests that by focusing on the process of how things are done – praising effort, experimentation and problem-solving strategies – we can encourage the development of new skills and the continued honing of talents."

Some news makes us think the world is becoming more violent. But there is also good news. From the end of World War II until 1990, there were 30 wars that killed over 100,000 people each. Today, there are still wars inside countries, but countries are living together in peace more often than before. However, terrorist attacks have become much more common in recent years. Also, since World War II, wars have killed many more ordinary people than soldiers. Even so, the numbers for ordinary people are not all bad. Violent crime is nine times more likely to cause death than wars between countries. But the number of murders around the world went down a little. In 2000, 8 people out of every 100,000 were murdered.

For example, the song ""Glory Days"" is about people from a small town remembering when they were young and full of hope. ""Downbound Train"" tells the story of a young man whose life falls apart after he loses his job.

For my generation, this isn’t such a big problem because we lived without technology for many years. We know how to be alone, and more importantly, we’re okay with it. But young people under 20 are different. They’re always busy messaging or chatting online, so they never really feel what it’s like to be alone. This means they might never learn to enjoy their own company. Also, they’re learning how to talk through messages they can edit and rewrite. Because of this, they might miss out on learning how to have real, face-to-face conversations with someone right in front of them.",qwen3-235b-a22b-2507,descr,"So much of what the speaker said rang true. I honestly believe there's a danger that the more connected we are, the more isolated we feel. I don't think this is such an issue for my generation who've lived without technology for so long. We know how to be alone and, more importantly, we know that it's OK to be alone. But the under 20s are another kettle of fish. They're so busy communicating that they never experience the feeling of solitude and run the risk of not learning how to enjoy their own company. In addition, they're learning conversation through messages that can be edited and changed at the expense of learning the art of real conversation in real time with the person in front of you."
120-a2,"Don't always give negative feedback after positive feedback. If they always come together, people might start ignoring the good comments. Sometimes, just give praise on its own and avoid adding criticism.",qwen3-235b-a22b-2507,descr,"Don't always follow positive feedback with negative feedback. When positive and negative feedback always appear to go hand in hand, the positives can become devalued and ignored. Ensure there are times when positive feedback is given for its own sake and resist the temptation to offer constructive criticism."
