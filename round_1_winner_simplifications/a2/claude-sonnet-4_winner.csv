21-a2,"Your dreams might show you new ideas about things you didn't know you were thinking about. Common dreams like flying or falling, your teeth falling out or being naked in public probably mean something similar for most people. But to understand what they really mean for you, you need to connect them to what happens and how you feel in your everyday life.",claude-sonnet-4,descr,"Your dreams might show you all kinds of insights into things that you didn't realise you were thinking about. Common dreams like being able to fly or falling, your teeth falling out or having no clothes on in a public place probably mean something similar in most people. But the key to understanding exactly what they mean to you is to connect them to the events and feelings in your daily life."
22-a2,"There are about 35,000 wild dogs living on the streets of Moscow. Some dogs were born on the streets. Other dogs were pets, but their owners left them. Some dogs live alone and some live in groups. In 2010, scientists studied these dogs. They found that the dogs learned to live well in the city. The dogs know it is safer to cross the street with people. Some dogs can understand traffic lights.",claude-sonnet-4,short,"One of the most interesting cases of wild animals living in a city are the wild dogs of Moscow. In Moscow, there are approximately 35,000 wild dogs living on the streets. Some of the dogs were born wild, while others are pets that have been abandoned by their owners. Some dogs live alone and others live in packs. In 2010, scientists studied the dogs and found that the dogs have adapted remarkably successfully to urban life. They have learned that it is safer to cross the street with people and some dogs appear to understand traffic lights."
23-a2,"Wonder is New Yorker RJ Palacio's first book. On her website, she says that the idea for the book came to her after seeing a girl with face problems on the street one day. Wonder has sold very well in the United States and has already won several prizes. Many schools are using it to start talks about bullying, friendship and what it's like to be different.

24-a2,"Chloe has two pet rats, Zena and Roxy. Chloe knows they are not normal pets. Many times, people say rats are dirty. Chloe tells them that rats are not dirty and they are very good pets if you take care of them well. But she understands why people don't like rats. Chloe didn't like rats before too. Then her friend Martin showed her his pet rats. She saw that rats are loving and smart animals. Last year, one of Martin's rats had babies. Chloe wanted to have two of them.",claude-sonnet-4,short,"Chloe has two pet rats, Zena and Roxy. Chloe knows they're not typical pets and she has lost count of the times she's patiently tried to explain to people that rats aren't dirty and they make fantastic pets if you look after them correctly.

Last year, when one of Martin's rats had babies, Chloe decided she'd like to have two of them."
25-a2,"Cape Town can be a dangerous place for baboons. Some baboons get hurt or die in car accidents. Others die when they touch electric wires while playing. Baboons are animals that might disappear forever if we don't protect them. To save the baboons and stop problems between people and baboons, the city has workers called Baboon Monitors. These workers chase baboons away from the city or catch them and take them to the countryside. This plan works sometimes, but it is difficult to stop baboons from coming back to the city. The baboons come back because they think the city is a place where they can find food easily.",claude-sonnet-4,descr_ex,"Cape Town can be a dangerous place for baboons. Some have been injured or killed in car accidents and others have been electrocuted as they played with electric cables. Baboons are an endangered species and to save them and minimise conflicts between humans and baboons, the city council has employed a team of Baboon Monitors. The monitors' job is to chase baboons out of urban areas or catch them and release them in the countryside. This policy has had some success, though it is proving hard to stop baboons from coming back to the city once they see it as a source of easy food."
26-a2,"I work for a big computer company around the world, but their main office is in America, so I do all my work on my computer at home. This means that I don't lose time traveling to work or talking about small things with other workers. I work on different projects, and I can choose when to work. This is very good for me because I can easily stop working when my children need me to go to their school shows or when I need to go to the dentist. The bad thing is that I don't have fixed work hours, so I often work until late at night, sometimes I don't eat dinner because I want to finish my work.",claude-sonnet-4,descr_ex,"I work for a global IT company, but because their headquarters is in the States, I do all my work online from home. That means that I don't waste time commuting or making idle chit-chat with colleagues. I work on a project basis, and this flexibility is very valuable to me because it means that I can easily take some time off when my children need me to go to their school performances or if I need to schedule an appointment with the dentist. The downside is that without clear office hours, I tend to work well into the evening, sometimes skipping dinner to finish a task. "
27-a2,"In the 1990s, graffiti continued but street art also became very popular around the world. Some artists wanted to talk about politics. They made art about war and unfair treatment of people.

In South America, many street artists went to work in poor areas adding colour, life and beauty to grey, city walls."
28-a2,"Social media, magazines and shop windows show people many things to buy every day, and British people are buying more clothes and shoes than ever before.

29-a2,"Sam looked at the sun and saw dust from a car going to the Big House. It was hard to see because the sun was very bright. The horses moved around and hit flies with their tails. They didn't care that their owner was visiting for the first time in ten months. Sam waited. Mr Carter only came here when he really had to, and Sam was happy about that. If he stayed away from his boss, he could keep his job longer. Mr Carter cleaned the water from his neck because he was hot. His shirt was wet in many places that looked like shapes on a map.

The more he kept out of his boss's way, the longer he'd have a job. Mr, Carter wiped the sweat from the back of his neck. The damp patches on his shirt drew together like shapes in an atlas. His skin was already turning ruddy in the June sun. Otherwise he had the indoor tan of a man that made money while other people did the work."
30-a2,"People in Berlin, Germany said that killing pigs was too cruel. Hunters and animal lovers had big arguments about this. Because of the protests, the city decided to try peaceful ways to stop the pigs. Now they don't shoot them. Instead, they built fences and made a law that people cannot feed the pigs. We don't know if this will work yet. It might be difficult because winters are warmer now, so there are more pigs than before.",claude-sonnet-4,short,"Many city residents in Berlin, Germany complained that shooting pigs was unnecessarily cruel and there were heated arguments between hunters and animal lovers. In response to protests, the city council decided to take more peaceful action against pigs. Instead of shooting them, they have put up fences and made it illegal to feed the pigs. Time will tell if this strategy works, though it may be a losing battle as warmer winters mean that pig numbers are greater than in the past."
31-a2,"An important idea for the Hunger Games book comes from Suzanne's love of old Greek stories. When she was a child, one of her favourite stories was about Theseus and the Minotaur. In this story, the city of Athens must do what Crete says, but the people from Athens fight back. Because of this, Minos the king of Crete makes the people from Athens send seven boys and seven girls to Crete every year.

32-a2,"By bringing people and animals together, zoos can teach people about saving animals and make people want to protect animals and the places where they live.

33-a2,"A different idea is starting because people don't want to buy so many things – the 'buy nothing' idea. This idea started in Canada in the early 1990s and then went to the US. There, it became a way to say no to spending too much money and buying too many things on Black Friday and Cyber Monday during Thanksgiving weekend.

36-a2,"Most people have four to six dreams every night after they are ten years old. That means about 2,000 dreams every year. So when a person is 80 years old, they might have had 140,000 dreams in their life. We forget most of our dreams - maybe 95 to 99 out of 100 dreams. But we still remember a few thousand dreams in our whole life. Sometimes we dream about something, and then the same thing happens in real life later. This can happen by chance, especially if we dream about things that happen often in everyday life. So it's not strange when a dream and real life are similar.",claude-sonnet-4,descr_ex,"If most people have four to six dreams every night after the age of ten, that's as many as 2,000 dreams per year. So, by the time they reach 80 years old the average person might have had 140,000 dreams. Even if we forget 95–99 per cent of our dreams, that's still a few thousand remembered dreams across a lifetime. It's not too difficult to believe that, by coincidence, a dream event is followed by a real-life event that's similar to it, especially if the subject of the dream is something that happens often in everyday life."
37-a2,"The Hunger Games happens in the future, after North America was destroyed. The country is called Panem and has twelve poor areas called districts. A rich place called the Capitol controls all of them. The Capitol has all the power in the country. Each district must make different things for the Capitol.

This sounds like something from a movie, and it was in the 1998 movie Armageddon, but HAMMER is a real plan from NASA. HAMMER means ""Hypervelocity Asteroid Mitigation Mission for Emergency Response."" The plan uses very heavy rockets that weigh eight tons. Scientists would send these rockets to hit a space rock that is coming toward Earth. They hope this would push the space rock away from Earth. If the space rock is too close to Earth and this plan cannot work, the rockets would carry nuclear bombs to break the space rock into small pieces.",claude-sonnet-4,descr_ex,"Another suggested defence against a PHA on course to hit Earth is to blow it up using a nuclear weapon.

44-a2,"Around 200-300 years ago, two main ideas about dreams became popular. One idea was that the things we see in our dreams show things that are hidden in our mind. Freud (a famous doctor who studied the mind) believed that if we understand what dreams are telling us, we can understand our hidden feelings and the problems they cause. However, the other idea was the opposite. It said that dreams are just a mix of random things happening in the brain while it's putting together memories and things from the day.

At first, I was working at home, but I found it really hard to think clearly about my work. There were too many things that took my attention away: cleaning the house, making another cup of tea, my family asking me to help them with different things. So I started to go to a coffee shop near my house to work, but the internet wasn't very good and I drank too much coffee.

Also, when there are fewer wild animals, there is more danger that all the animals become too similar to each other. Baby-making programs help with this problem: animals born in zoos can go back to nature to make the animal groups more different from each other.",claude-sonnet-4,descr,"One of the most important modern functions of zoos is supporting international breeding programmes, particularly for endangered species. In the wild, some of the rarest species have difficulty in finding mates and breeding, and they might also be threatened by poachers, loss of their habitat and predators. A good zoo will enable these species to live and breed in a secure environment. In addition, as numbers of some wild species drop, there is an increased danger of populations becoming too genetically similar. Breeding programmes provide a safeguard: zoo-bred animals can be released into the wild to increase genetic diversity."

91-a2,"Good relationships are very important for happiness. In one study, happy people had strong connections with friends and family. They spent time with them often. You need at least one person to talk about your personal feelings with. Just one person is enough for deep conversations, plus other friends too. It's not enough to have many friends just for activities or to talk about music or sports. That deeper connection is very important. Some people need to learn how to listen well to others to make stronger relationships.",claude-sonnet-4,short,"Having good relationships is a big part of being happy. In one study, most happy people were found to have strong ties to friends and family and they made sure they spent time with them regularly. You also need at least one person who you discuss personal feelings with – called 'self-disclosure'. Just one person for a heart-to-heart is enough, together with a network of other relationships. It's not enough to have lots of friends just to do things with or chat to about music or football. That deeper connection is all-important. Some people need to learn how to listen effectively to others in order to develop stronger relationships."
92-a2,"Carol Dweck is a psychologist who talks about 'growth mindset'. She says our brain can change and we can learn new skills. We can get better at things we were not good at before. Many people like to praise the final result and natural talents. For example, they say 'You are really good at seeing small things' or 'You are very good at planning parties'. But research shows something different. When we praise how people do things - when we praise their hard work, trying new things, and how they solve problems - we help them learn new skills. This also helps them get better at things they already know how to do.",claude-sonnet-4,descr_ex,"Psychologist and 'growth mindset' proponent Carol Dweck spoke of the plasticity of the brain and our ability to develop skills and talents that we might not have been good at to start with. Many of us tend to focus our praise on the end result and seemingly innate talents, e.g. 'You really have an eye for details' or 'You have a real talent for organising events'. However, research suggests that by focusing on the process of how things are done – praising effort, experimentation and problem-solving strategies – we can encourage the development of new skills and the continued honing of talents."

Organic molecules are chemicals that contain carbon and are found in living things. One thing about methane is that it only lasts a few hundred years. This means that something, somewhere on Mars, is making new methane all the time. NASA says Mars sends out thousands of tons of methane at once. The amount of methane goes up and down at different times of the year, almost like the planet is breathing it.",claude-sonnet-4,descr,"The rover analyses the air around it periodically, and in 2014 it found the air contained another of the most basic organic molecules and a key ingredient of natural gas: methane.

According to NASA, Mars emits thousands of tons of methane at a time. The level of methane rises and falls at seasonal intervals in the year, almost as if the planet is breathing it."

But another group of children felt that someone was testing how smart they were and they had failed. They had a 'fixed mindset' - this means they believe they cannot change or get better.

How can we expect teenagers not to send messages while doing their homework when they see their parents writing on Facebook while cooking dinner or waiting at traffic lights? She also made a good point about people wanting to be in two or more places at the same time. So they go back and forth between their real conversations and online conversations.

But terrorism has increased a lot in recent years. Also, since World War II, wars have killed many more ordinary people than soldiers. Even for ordinary people, the numbers are not all bad.

But when this becomes a normal habit, workers can start to think that positive feedback is just a way to make the bad news sound better. This makes the positive feedback less meaningful. Instead, positive feedback should not just be used to make negative feedback softer. It should be given to support and encourage good work.",claude-sonnet-4,descr,"In an attempt to inject some positivity into their feedback, many managers rely on sandwiching negative feedback between two positive comments. However, when feedback becomes such a routine, employees can start to perceive positive feedback as simply a form of sugarcoating the negatives, thus diminishing its value. Instead, positive feedback should not simply be seen as something to cushion the negative, but should be delivered so as to reinforce and encourage good performance."

But Chinese has the most native speakers - people who learned it as their first language when they were children.

The song Glory Days is about people in a small town who remember when they were young and everything seemed possible. Downbound Train tells the story of a young man whose life goes wrong when he loses his job.

The song Glory Days, for example, is about people in a small town looking back at when they were young and had the world at their feet while Downbound Train tells the story of a young man whose life is ruined when he loses his job.

It was easy to transport because it had thick skin, and it tasted sweet. This banana plant was the most popular one in Central America. United Fruit was the biggest company that grew and sold bananas in South America at that time. They wanted to make as many bananas as possible in the easiest way.

Things left by people who lived long ago don't tell us what sounds they could make when they talked. One thing we can see in the bones of early humans is how the mouth, throat and tongue grew and changed. About 100,000 years ago, humans could make many different sounds.

Furthermore, there is an unfortunate perception that scientists are geeky, have poor social skills or that their work is lonely and detached from the rest of the world. These are false stereotypes portrayed by the media, but they may mean that girls do not identify with scientists, and see science as an unappealing career path.

I don't think this is a big problem for my generation because we lived without technology for so long. We know how to be alone and, more importantly, we know that it's OK to be alone. But people under 20 are completely different. They're so busy talking to others through phones and computers that they never feel what it's like to be alone and they might not learn how to enjoy being by themselves.
