21-b1,"Your dreams might tell you about thoughts you didn’t know you had. Common dreams—like flying, falling, losing your teeth, or being in public without clothes—often mean something similar for many people. But to understand what they really mean for you, think about what is happening in your life and how you feel every day.",qwen3-235b-a22b-2507,descr_ex,"Your dreams might show you all kinds of insights into things that you didn't realise you were thinking about. Common dreams like being able to fly or falling, your teeth falling out or having no clothes on in a public place probably mean something similar in most people. But the key to understanding exactly what they mean to you is to connect them to the events and feelings in your daily life."
22-b1,"One of the most interesting examples of wild animals living in a city is the wild dogs of Moscow. About 35,000 wild dogs live on the streets of the city. Some of these dogs were born in the wild, and others are pets that their owners left. Some dogs live alone, while others live in groups called packs. In 2010, scientists studied these dogs and found that they have adapted very well to city life. They have learned that it is safer to cross the street when people are crossing, and some dogs even seem to understand traffic lights.",qwen3-235b-a22b-2507,descr_ex,"One of the most interesting cases of wild animals living in a city are the wild dogs of Moscow.

24-b1,"Chloe has two pet rats named Zena and Roxy. She knows rats are not common pets, and she can't remember how many times she has explained to people that rats are not dirty. She tells them that rats can be great pets if you take good care of them. But she understands why some people don't like rats — she didn't like them either, until her friend Martin showed her his pet rats. She saw how loving and smart they were.

25-b1,"Cape Town can be dangerous for baboons. Some have been hurt or killed in car accidents, and others have died after touching electric wires while playing. Baboons are an endangered species. To protect them and reduce problems between people and baboons, the city has hired Baboon Monitors. These workers chase baboons out of towns or catch them and take them back to the wild. This plan has helped a little, but it is difficult to stop baboons from returning to the city, especially when they find easy food there.",qwen3-235b-a22b-2507,descr,"Cape Town can be a dangerous place for baboons.

26-b1,"I work for a big international IT company. Since the main office is in the United States, I work from home using the internet. This means I don’t have to travel to work or spend time chatting with coworkers. I work on projects, and I like this because it gives me flexibility. I can take time off when my children need me, like for school events, or when I have a dentist appointment. The problem is that I don’t have fixed working hours, so I often work late into the night. Sometimes I even miss dinner to finish a job.",qwen3-235b-a22b-2507,descr,"I work for a global IT company, but because their headquarters is in the States, I do all my work online from home.

The downside is that without clear office hours, I tend to work well into the evening, sometimes skipping dinner to finish a task. "
27-b1,"In the 1990s, graffiti stayed popular, but street art also grew quickly around the world.

29-b1,"Sam narrowed his eyes, looking at the dust cloud made by the car driving up to the Big House. The horses kicked their legs and swished their tails at flies, not bothered by their owner’s arrival. It was his first visit in ten months. Sam stood and waited. Mr. Carter rarely came here unless necessary, and Sam preferred it that way. The less he saw his boss, the more likely he would keep his job. Mr. Carter wiped sweat from the back of his neck.

30-b1,"Many people in Berlin, Germany said killing wild pigs was too cruel. This caused strong arguments between hunters and animal lovers. Because of the protests, the city government decided to try a more peaceful way to deal with the pigs. Instead of shooting them, they built fences and made it against the law to feed the pigs.

Time will tell if this strategy works, though it may be a losing battle as warmer winters mean that pig numbers are greater than in the past."
31-b1,"One big inspiration for the Hunger Games book is Suzanne Collins' love for Greek myths. When she was young, her favorite story was Theseus and the Minotaur. In the story, Athens is ruled by Crete, but the people of Athens fight back. As punishment, King Minos of Crete makes Athens send seven boys and seven girls every year.

33-b1,"A new trend is growing that goes against consumerism – the 'buy nothing' trend. It started in Canada in the early 1990s and then spread to the US. There, it became a way to say no to the heavy spending and buying on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, which happen during Thanksgiving weekend.

36-b1,"Most people have four to six dreams every night after the age of ten. That means up to 2,000 dreams each year. By the time someone is 80 years old, they may have had around 140,000 dreams.

91-b1,"Good relationships are a big part of being happy. One study found that most happy people have strong connections with family and friends, and they make time to be with them regularly. It’s also important to have at least one person you can talk to about your personal feelings. This is called 'self-disclosure'. Just one person to share your thoughts and feelings with is enough, as long as you also have other good relationships around you. It’s not enough to only have friends you do things with or talk about hobbies like music or football. A deeper connection really matters. Some people need to learn how to listen well to others so they can build stronger, closer relationships.",qwen3-235b-a22b-2507,descr_ex,"Having good relationships is a big part of being happy.

92-b1,"Psychologist Carol Dweck, who supports the idea of a ""growth mindset,"" says the brain can change and grow. This means we can develop skills we weren’t good at in the beginning. Often, people praise results or natural talent, like saying, “You’re so good at noticing small details” or “You’re a natural at planning events.” But studies show it’s better to praise the process — for example, the effort someone puts in, how they try new ways, or how they solve problems. This kind of praise helps people keep learning and improving their skills.",qwen3-235b-a22b-2507,descr,"Psychologist and 'growth mindset' proponent Carol Dweck spoke of the plasticity of the brain and our ability to develop skills and talents that we might not have been good at to start with. Many of us tend to focus our praise on the end result and seemingly innate talents, e.g. 'You really have an eye for details' or 'You have a real talent for organising events'. However, research suggests that by focusing on the process of how things are done – praising effort, experimentation and problem-solving strategies – we can encourage the development of new skills and the continued honing of talents."

But another group felt stressed, as if their intelligence was being tested and they had failed. Dweck called this a 'fixed mindset' — they believed their abilities could not change.

The songs show the difficult side of the American dream. Many are about regular people who work hard but don’t become rich or famous. They feel disappointed and angry.

For example, the song ""Glory Days"" is about people from a small town remembering their youth, when they felt strong and full of hope. ""Downbound Train"" tells the story of a young man whose life falls apart after he loses his job.

They're so busy communicating that they never experience the feeling of solitude and run the risk of not learning how to enjoy their own company. In addition, they're learning conversation through messages that can be edited and changed at the expense of learning the art of real conversation in real time with the person in front of you."

When positive and negative feedback always appear to go hand in hand, the positives can become devalued and ignored. Ensure there are times when positive feedback is given for its own sake and resist the temptation to offer constructive criticism."
