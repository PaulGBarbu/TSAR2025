22-b1,"One of the most interesting examples of wild animals living in cities are the wild dogs of Moscow. In Moscow, there are about 35,000 wild dogs living on the streets. Some of these dogs were born in the wild, while others were once pets that were left behind by their owners. Some dogs live alone, while others live in groups. In 2010, researchers studied these dogs and found that they have adapted very well to city life.

25-b1,"Cape Town is a risky place for baboons. Some get hurt or killed in car accidents, and others get shocked when they play with electric cables. Baboons are in danger of disappearing, so the city council hired a team called Baboon Monitors to help. Their job is to chase baboons out of the city or catch and release them in rural areas.

In one study, most happy people were found to have strong ties to friends and family and they made sure they spent time with them regularly. You also need at least one person who you discuss personal feelings with – called 'self-disclosure'. Just one person for a heart-to-heart is enough, together with a network of other relationships. It's not enough to have lots of friends just to do things with or chat to about music or football. That deeper connection is all-important. Some people need to learn how to listen effectively to others in order to develop stronger relationships."
92-b1,"Carol Dweck, a psychologist who supports the idea of a 'growth mindset,' talked about how our brains can change and grow. She explained that we can develop skills and talents that we weren’t necessarily good at from the beginning. When we praise others, we often focus on their results or natural talents, like saying, ""You really have an eye for details"" or ""You have a real talent for organizing events."" But research shows that if we focus on how people do things and praise their effort, creativity, and problem-solving, we can help them develop new skills and keep improving the ones they have.",deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b,descr,"Psychologist and 'growth mindset' proponent Carol Dweck spoke of the plasticity of the brain and our ability to develop skills and talents that we might not have been good at to start with. Many of us tend to focus our praise on the end result and seemingly innate talents, e.g. 'You really have an eye for details' or 'You have a real talent for organising events'. However, research suggests that by focusing on the process of how things are done – praising effort, experimentation and problem-solving strategies – we can encourage the development of new skills and the continued honing of talents."

Methane doesn’t last very long in the atmosphere—it only survives for a few hundred years. This suggests that something on Mars is continuously producing more of it. NASA reports that Mars releases large amounts of methane at certain times. The levels of methane in the atmosphere go up and down during different seasons, almost like the planet is breathing.",deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b,descr,"The rover analyses the air around it periodically, and in 2014 it found the air contained another of the most basic organic molecules and a key ingredient of natural gas: methane.

According to NASA, Mars emits thousands of tons of methane at a time. The level of methane rises and falls at seasonal intervals in the year, almost as if the planet is breathing it."

For example, *Glory Days* is about people in a small town remembering when they were young and full of hope. *Downbound Train* tells the story of a young man whose life falls apart after losing his job.
