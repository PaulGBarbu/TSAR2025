21-b1,"Your dreams can give you ideas about things you didn’t know you were thinking about. Common dreams, like flying, falling, losing teeth, or being naked in public, probably have similar meanings for most people. But to really understand what they mean for you, think about how they connect to your daily life and feelings.",mistral-medium-3,short,"Your dreams might show you all kinds of insights into things that you didn't realise you were thinking about. Common dreams like being able to fly or falling, your teeth falling out or having no clothes on in a public place probably mean something similar in most people.

22-b1,"One of the most interesting examples of wild animals living in cities is the wild dogs of Moscow. In Moscow, about 35,000 wild dogs live on the streets. Some of these dogs were born wild, while others were pets that their owners left behind. Some dogs live alone, and others live in groups.

In 2010, scientists studied these dogs and discovered that they have adapted very well to city life. For example, they have learned that it is safer to cross the street with people. Some dogs even seem to understand traffic lights.",mistral-medium-3,descr,"One of the most interesting cases of wild animals living in a city are the wild dogs of Moscow.

23-b1,"*Wonder* is the first book by New Yorker RJ Palacio. On her website, she says she got the idea for the story after seeing a girl with a different-looking face on the street. The book has been very popular in the United States and has won many prizes. Schools are using it to talk about bullying, friendship, and how it feels to be different. A movie is being made from the book, and many people, including me, are excited to read RJ Palacio’s next book.",mistral-medium-3,descr_ex,"Wonder is New Yorker RJ Palacio's first novel.

24-b1,"Chloe has two pet rats named Zena and Roxy. She knows that rats are not common pets, and she has often explained to people that rats are not dirty. If you take care of them well, they can be great pets. She understands why some people don’t like rats because she didn’t like them either at first. But then her friend Martin showed her his pet rats, and she saw how loving and smart they were. Last year, when one of Martin’s rats had babies, Chloe decided she wanted two of them.",mistral-medium-3,descr,"Chloe has two pet rats, Zena and Roxy.

Last year, when one of Martin's rats had babies, Chloe decided she'd like to have two of them."
25-b1,"Cape Town can be dangerous for baboons. Some have been hurt or killed by cars, and others have died from touching electric wires. Baboons are in danger of disappearing, so the city has hired a team of Baboon Monitors to protect them and reduce problems between people and baboons. The monitors chase baboons away from the city or catch them and take them to the countryside. This has worked a little, but it is difficult to keep baboons away from the city because they remember it as a place where they can easily find food.",mistral-medium-3,descr_ex,"Cape Town can be a dangerous place for baboons. Some have been injured or killed in car accidents and others have been electrocuted as they played with electric cables. Baboons are an endangered species and to save them and minimise conflicts between humans and baboons, the city council has employed a team of Baboon Monitors. The monitors' job is to chase baboons out of urban areas or catch them and release them in the countryside. This policy has had some success, though it is proving hard to stop baboons from coming back to the city once they see it as a source of easy food."
26-b1,"I work for a big IT company, but their main office is in the USA. So, I do all my work from home online. This way, I don’t spend time traveling to work or talking with coworkers. I work on different projects, and this flexibility is great because I can take time off when my kids need me, like for school events, or if I need to see the dentist. The bad part is that since I don’t have fixed work hours, I often work late into the evening and sometimes skip dinner to finish my work.",mistral-medium-3,short,"I work for a global IT company, but because their headquarters is in the States, I do all my work online from home.

The downside is that without clear office hours, I tend to work well into the evening, sometimes skipping dinner to finish a task. "
27-b1,"In the 1990s, graffiti was still popular, but street art also became very common worldwide. Some artists used their work to share political messages, making people think about important issues like war, unfairness, and discrimination.

The horses moved restlessly, swatting flies with their tails, not caring that their owner was visiting for the first time in ten months. Sam waited. Mr. Carter rarely came out here unless he had to, which was fine with Sam. The less he saw his boss, the better—it meant he could keep his job longer.

Mr. Carter wiped the sweat from his neck. The wet spots on his shirt looked like strange shapes on a map. His skin was already turning red from the June sun.

30-b1,"Many people in Berlin, Germany, were upset because they thought shooting wild pigs was too cruel. There were big arguments between hunters and people who love animals. Because of the protests, the city government decided to try a kinder way to control the pigs. Now, they are building fences and making it against the law to feed the pigs. We don’t know yet if this will work, but it might be hard because warmer winters mean there are more pigs than before.",mistral-medium-3,descr_ex,"Many city residents in Berlin, Germany complained that shooting pigs was unnecessarily cruel and there were heated arguments between hunters and animal lovers.

36-b1,"Most people have four to six dreams every night after age ten. That means about 2,000 dreams a year. By the time someone is 80 years old, they might have had around 140,000 dreams.

This might sound like a movie plot—it was even in the 1998 film *Armageddon*—but it is a real plan from NASA.

A good zoo gives these animals a safe place to live and have babies. Also, when there are fewer animals in the wild, the ones that are left can become too similar in their genes, which is not good. Breeding programs help with this problem because animals born in zoos can be released back into nature to make the wild groups stronger and more different in their genes.",mistral-medium-3,descr_ex,"One of the most important modern functions of zoos is supporting international breeding programmes, particularly for endangered species.

Many of us tend to focus our praise on the end result and seemingly innate talents, e.g. 'You really have an eye for details' or 'You have a real talent for organising events'. However, research suggests that by focusing on the process of how things are done – praising effort, experimentation and problem-solving strategies – we can encourage the development of new skills and the continued honing of talents."
93-b1,"The rover checks the air around it regularly. In 2014, it discovered that the air contained methane, a simple organic molecule and a key part of natural gas. Methane does not last long—only a few hundred years—so something on Mars must be creating more of it. NASA says Mars releases thousands of tons of methane at once. The amount of methane goes up and down with the seasons, almost like the planet is breathing it in and out.",mistral-medium-3,short,"The rover analyses the air around it periodically, and in 2014 it found the air contained another of the most basic organic molecules and a key ingredient of natural gas: methane. One of the characteristics of methane is that it only survives a few hundred years. This means that something, somewhere on Mars, is replenishing the supply. According to NASA, Mars emits thousands of tons of methane at a time. The level of methane rises and falls at seasonal intervals in the year, almost as if the planet is breathing it."
94-b1,"Early in her work, psychologist Carol Dweck from Stanford University gave some ten-year-old children problems that were a little too difficult for them. One group reacted well. They enjoyed the challenge and believed they could get better with practice. Dweck called this a ""growth mindset,"" where people focus on what they can learn and achieve in the future.

But another group felt like they had failed and thought the test was judging their intelligence. They had a ""fixed mindset,"" meaning they didn’t believe they could improve. Some of these children even said they might cheat next time, while others tried to feel better by finding someone who did worse than them.",mistral-medium-3,descr_ex,"Early in her career, the psychologist Carol Dweck of Stanford University gave a group of ten-year-olds problems that were slightly too hard for them.

95-b1,"Horror movies often use empty, abandoned places like old hospitals, creepy houses, or ghost towns. These lonely spots make us wonder: What happened there? Why did people leave? The silence can also feel very scary. Plus, in these places, it’s easy to believe that your phone won’t work, which makes the situation even more frightening. That’s why filmmakers like to use them.",mistral-medium-3,descr,"Horror films love uninhabited places. This could be an abandoned hospital, a scary empty house or a ghost town. There's something about lonely, empty places. What was it like when people lived there? Why did they leave? Maybe it's also that they are so quiet, which can be very scary too. Of course, abandoned places are also handy for horror film directors in that it's more believable that you will have no phone coverage there either."
96-b1,"In horror movies, basements are always scary, no matter what kind of house it is. That’s usually where something is hiding, or where a dangerous person keeps their tools.

He quickly recognised some of the people and decided to end his holiday early to help the police. He spent six months looking at CCTV videos and was able to identify 190 people, often just by looking at their eyes. His help was very important for the investigation.

99-b1,"The talk was very interesting, and the speaker made some great points. For example, she talked about how parents influence their children. If parents use their phones while cooking or driving, how can we expect teenagers not to use their phones while doing homework?

She also had a good point about people trying to do too many things at once. They switch between talking to people in real life and chatting online. I see this with my teenage daughter and her friends. They plan to meet, but then they sit together quietly while each one talks to different people online.",mistral-medium-3,descr,"It was a fascinating talk and the speaker really hit the nail on the head with a couple of things. Take parental influence, for instance. How can we expect teenagers not to text while doing their homework when they witness their parents posting on social media while cooking the evening meal or waiting at a red light? She also made a valid point about people wanting to be in two or several places at once. So they switch back and forth between their real-life and online conversations. I see it all the time with my teenage daughter and her friends. They arrange to meet and then sit together in silence while each one engages in a different conversation online."
100-b1,"Some news stories make us think the world is becoming more violent, but there are also reasons to be hopeful. Between the end of World War II and 1990, there were 30 wars where over 100,000 people died. Today, there are still civil wars, but most countries live together more peacefully than before. However, terrorism has increased in recent years, and since World War II, wars have killed far more civilians than soldiers.

For civilians, the situation is not all bad. While people are nine times more likely to die from violent crime than from war, the global murder rate has actually gone down a little. In 2000, about 8 out of every 100,000 people were murdered, but by 2015, that number had dropped to about 5.3.",mistral-medium-3,descr,"As for news stories that make us think the world is an increasingly violent place, there is cause for some optimism too.

Wasfia believed that Bangladesh needed to take action itself. She combined two things she loves—mountain climbing and human rights—to try to change how people in her country think about women. She started climbing while working on aid projects in Tibet and Nepal. In Bangladesh, which is mostly flat and near the coast, most people have never even seen a mountain.

Her efforts are working—people in Bangladesh and around the world are paying attention.",mistral-medium-3,descr,"Wasfia has dedicated her life to supporting human rights and has witnessed numerous international humanitarian projects in her homeland to educate and train women and girls, but once too often they have been left with nothing when such projects have stopped running. Wasfia saw that Bangladesh needed to stand up for itself and so she brought together two of her passions, mountaineering and human rights, in order to try and change attitudes towards women in her country. She originally took up climbing while working on humanitarian campaigns in Tibet and Nepal, as in a coastal, primarily flat country like Bangladesh most people have never set eyes on a mountain. Her campaign seems to be doing the trick as fellow countrymen and women are sitting up and taking notice along with the rest of the world. "

103-b1,"Many managers try to make feedback more positive by putting negative comments between two positive ones. This is called the ""sandwich method."" However, if this method is used too often, employees may start to see the positive comments as just a way to hide the negative ones. This makes the positive feedback less meaningful.

Instead, positive feedback should not just be used to soften negative comments. It should be given to support and encourage good work. This way, employees will value it more.",mistral-medium-3,descr,"In an attempt to inject some positivity into their feedback, many managers rely on sandwiching negative feedback between two positive comments. However, when feedback becomes such a routine, employees can start to perceive positive feedback as simply a form of sugarcoating the negatives, thus diminishing its value. Instead, positive feedback should not simply be seen as something to cushion the negative, but should be delivered so as to reinforce and encourage good performance."
104-b1,"I’m part of a group called the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots. Don’t think about scary movie robots like the Terminator crushing skulls. Instead, think about what’s happening today: the military already uses machines like drones and automated guns that can kill with almost no human control. The next step could be robots that make their own decisions about who to kill. This seems very wrong and dangerous for people. We must be extremely careful about what tasks we give to machines.",mistral-medium-3,descr,"I'm a member of the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots. Forget the movie image of a terrifying Terminator stamping on human skulls and think of what's happening right now: military machines like drones, gun turrets and sentry robots are already being used to kill with very little human input. The next step will be autonomous 'murderbots', following orders but ultimately deciding who to kill on their own. It seems clear to me that this would be completely unethical and dangerous for humanity. We need to be very cautious indeed about what we ask machines to do."

107-b1,"""Born in the USA"" is a lively rock album with fast, exciting music. But the words in the songs are deep and emotional. Behind the catchy tunes, the songs tell stories about the difficult side of the American dream. Many songs talk about the problems of regular people who work hard but never get rich or famous. They feel angry and disappointed because life doesn’t give them what they hoped for.

For example, the song ""Glory Days"" is about people in a small town remembering their youth when life seemed full of possibilities. ""Downbound Train"" tells the story of a young man whose life falls apart after he loses his job. It feels like the singer is writing about real people he knew and the life he might have had if he hadn’t become famous.

The album shows just how talented the artist, known as ""the Boss,"" really is.",mistral-medium-3,descr_ex,"A fast-paced, foot-tapping rock album, Born in the USA's lyrics nevertheless carry emotional weight. Behind the catchy rock melodies that drive these powerhouse classics are stories of the dark side of the American dream. Many tracks deal with the struggles of hard-working ordinary people and the bitterness and anger they feel as life doesn't bring them riches or glory. The song Glory Days, for example, is about people in a small town looking back at when they were young and had the world at their feet while Downbound Train tells the story of a young man whose life is ruined when he loses his job. It's not hard to imagine that the artist is channelling real people he knew and the life he might have had if he hadn't become a star. The album will leave you in no doubt of the unique and extraordinary talent of the Boss."

The Gros Michel was very popular because it was easy to transport, had thick skin, and tasted sweet. It was grown on large farms in Central America. The main company growing and selling these bananas, United Fruit, used a special method to grow them quickly. Instead of planting seeds, they took small parts from the stems of banana plants and grew new plants from them. They also planted the bananas very close together to save space.",mistral-medium-3,descr,"In the 1950s, Central American commercial banana growers were facing the death of their most lucrative product, the Gros Michel banana, known as Big Mike. And now it's happening again to Big Mike's successor – the Cavendish. With its easily transported, thick-skinned and sweet-tasting fruit, the Gros Michel banana plant dominated the plantations of Central America. United Fruit, the main grower and exporter in South America at the time, mass-produced its bananas in the most efficient way possible: it cloned shoots from the stems of plants instead of growing plants from seeds, and cultivated them in densely packed fields."
113-b1,"Most spiders have venom to catch their food, not to hurt people. Only 25 types of spiders have venom that can harm humans, and even though their bites can hurt, they are almost never deadly. For example, Australia’s dangerous Sydney funnel-web spider hasn’t caused any deaths since 1981, when a medicine (anti-venom) was made to treat its bites.

But be careful with hairy spiders like tarantulas. If they feel threatened, they can shoot out tiny, irritating hairs to protect themselves. These hairs can stick to your skin or eyes and cause discomfort.",mistral-medium-3,descr,"Spider venom is present in most species and serves the purpose of stunning or killing their prey rather than attacking humans. In fact, only 25 of the known spider species produce venom which can actually harm humans, and although spider bites can be painful, they are rarely deadly. Australia's notorious Sydney funnel-web spider has not produced any fatalities since anti-venom was developed in 1981. However, take care not to rub hairy spiders like tarantulas up the wrong way.

115-b1,"To understand where our ability to use complex language comes from, we need to compare our brains to those of other animals. It’s not just about the size of the brain—it’s also about what the brain can do and how it developed over time. Unfortunately, there are very few physical clues from our ancestors that show us what kind of speech they could produce.

However, we can see changes in the bones of early humans, especially in their mouths, throats, and tongues. By around 100,000 years ago, humans had developed the ability to make complex sounds. Before that time, scientists can only guess whether early humans used simpler sounds to communicate.",mistral-medium-3,descr,"If we want to know where our capability for complex language came from, we need to look at how our brains are different from other animals. This relates to more than just brain size; it is important what other things our brains can do and when and why they evolved that way. And for this there are very few physical clues; artefacts left by our ancestors don't tell us what speech they were capable of making. One thing we can see in the remains of early humans, however, is the development of the mouth, throat and tongue. By about 100,000 years ago, humans had evolved the ability to create complex sounds. Before that, evolutionary biologists can only guess whether or not early humans communicated using more basic sounds."
116-b1,"Society, not nature, makes people think that girls should like arts and humanities, while boys should study math and physics. Another problem is that young people don’t see many women working in science jobs. In cartoons and stories, scientists, inventors, and astronauts are usually men. Also, many people think scientists are strange, not good at socializing, or that their work is lonely and not connected to the real world. These ideas are not true, but the media often shows them this way. Because of this, girls may not feel like scientists and might not want to work in science. If girls saw more successful women in science, they would feel more confident and more interested in these subjects.",mistral-medium-3,descr,"It is society, not nature, that tells us girls should favour arts and humanities and leave maths and physics to the boys. Coupled with this is the lack of positive female role models youngsters see doing science-related jobs. Cartoons and stories often show the crazy scientist, genius inventor, or adventurous astronaut as a man. Furthermore, there is an unfortunate perception that scientists are geeky, have poor social skills or that their work is lonely and detached from the rest of the world. These are false stereotypes portrayed by the media, but they may mean that girls do not identify with scientists, and see science as an unappealing career path. If girls saw more positive female role models in science it would give them more confidence and a greater sense of belonging in those subjects."

119-b1,"I really agree with what the speaker said. I think there’s a problem: the more we connect online, the lonelier we might feel. This isn’t such a big issue for my generation because we grew up without so much technology. We know how to be alone, and we understand that being alone is fine. But young people under 20 are different. They spend so much time messaging others that they never really experience being alone. Because of this, they might not learn to enjoy their own company. Also, they learn to talk through messages that can be edited, which means they might not develop the skill of having real conversations face-to-face.",mistral-medium-3,descr,"So much of what the speaker said rang true. I honestly believe there's a danger that the more connected we are, the more isolated we feel. I don't think this is such an issue for my generation who've lived without technology for so long. We know how to be alone and, more importantly, we know that it's OK to be alone. But the under 20s are another kettle of fish. They're so busy communicating that they never experience the feeling of solitude and run the risk of not learning how to enjoy their own company. In addition, they're learning conversation through messages that can be edited and changed at the expense of learning the art of real conversation in real time with the person in front of you."
