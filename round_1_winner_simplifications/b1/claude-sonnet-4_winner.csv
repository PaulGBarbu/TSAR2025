21-b1,"Your dreams might show you important things about thoughts you didn't know you had. Many people have similar dreams - like flying, falling, losing teeth, or being naked in public places. These dreams probably mean similar things for most people. But to understand what your dreams really mean for you, you need to think about what is happening in your daily life and how you feel about it.",claude-sonnet-4,descr,"Your dreams might show you all kinds of insights into things that you didn't realise you were thinking about.

Some of the dogs were born wild, while others are pets that their owners left behind. Some dogs live alone and others live in groups. In 2010, scientists studied the dogs and found that the dogs have learned to live very well in the city.

25-b1,"Cape Town can be a dangerous place for baboons. Some have been hurt or killed in car accidents and others have died from electric shock when they played with electric wires. Baboons are an endangered species (animals that might disappear completely) and to save them and reduce problems between humans and baboons, the city council has hired a team of Baboon Monitors. The monitors' job is to chase baboons away from city areas or catch them and let them go free in the countryside.

27-b1,"In the 1990s, graffiti continued but street art also became very popular around the world. Some artists wanted to share political messages and created art that made people think about war, unfair treatment, and discrimination (when people are treated badly because of their race, gender, etc.).

They didn't care that their owner was visiting for the first time in ten months. Sam waited. Mr Carter only came out here when he really had to, and Sam was happy about that. If he stayed away from his boss, he could keep his job longer. Mr Carter cleaned the sweat from his neck. His shirt was wet in several places that joined together like countries on a map.

30-b1,"Many people living in Berlin, Germany said that killing pigs with guns was too cruel and there were angry discussions between hunters and people who love animals. Because people complained, the city government decided to try more peaceful ways to deal with the pigs.

36-b1,"Most people have four to six dreams every night after they turn ten years old. That means about 2,000 dreams each year. So when someone reaches 80 years old, they might have had 140,000 dreams in their life. We forget most of our dreams - about 95 to 99 percent of them. But that still leaves a few thousand dreams that we remember during our lifetime. So it's easy to understand why sometimes we dream about something, and then something similar happens in real life.

A good zoo gives these animals a safe place to live and have babies.

91-b1,"Having good relationships is very important for being happy. In one study, researchers found that most happy people had strong connections with friends and family, and they spent time with them often. You also need at least one person who you can talk to about your personal feelings - this is called 'self-disclosure' (sharing your private thoughts and emotions). Just one person for deep, honest conversations is enough, along with other friendships. It's not enough to have many friends just to hang out with or talk about music or football. That deeper connection is the most important thing. Some people need to learn how to listen well to others so they can build stronger relationships.",claude-sonnet-4,descr,"Having good relationships is a big part of being happy.

92-b1,"Psychologist Carol Dweck studies something called 'growth mindset'. She talks about how our brains can change and how we can get better at things we weren't good at before. Most of us usually praise the final results and natural abilities. For example, we say things like 'You really notice small details well' or 'You're naturally good at organizing events'. But research shows that we should focus on how people do things instead. When we praise effort, trying new things, and ways of solving problems, we help people develop new skills and keep improving their talents.",claude-sonnet-4,descr,"Psychologist and 'growth mindset' proponent Carol Dweck spoke of the plasticity of the brain and our ability to develop skills and talents that we might not have been good at to start with. Many of us tend to focus our praise on the end result and seemingly innate talents, e.g. 'You really have an eye for details' or 'You have a real talent for organising events'. However, research suggests that by focusing on the process of how things are done – praising effort, experimentation and problem-solving strategies – we can encourage the development of new skills and the continued honing of talents."
93-b1,"The rover checks the air around it from time to time, and in 2014 it found the air had another very simple organic molecule (a basic chemical found in living things) and an important part of natural gas: methane. One thing about methane is that it only lasts a few hundred years. This means that something, somewhere on Mars, is making new methane all the time. NASA says Mars releases thousands of tons of methane at once. The amount of methane goes up and down during different seasons of the year, almost like the planet is breathing it in and out.",claude-sonnet-4,descr_ex,"The rover analyses the air around it periodically, and in 2014 it found the air contained another of the most basic organic molecules and a key ingredient of natural gas: methane.

They said they loved the challenge and understood that they could get better at things with practice. Dweck says these children had a 'growth mindset' - this means they believe they can improve and develop their abilities. They focus on what they can learn and achieve in the future. But another group of children felt that Dweck was testing how smart they were, and they thought they had failed.

There's something special about quiet, empty places. What was life like when people lived there? Why did they go away?

How can we expect teenagers not to send messages while doing their homework when they see their parents using Facebook or Instagram while cooking dinner or waiting at traffic lights?

But too often these projects end and leave the women with nothing. Wasfia realized that Bangladesh needed to help itself, so she combined two things she loves - mountain climbing and human rights - to try to change how people think about women in her country. She first started climbing when she was working on humanitarian campaigns (projects that help people) in Tibet and Nepal.

But when this becomes a normal pattern, employees start to think that positive comments are just a way to make the bad news sound better. This makes the positive feedback less meaningful.

It should be given to strengthen and encourage good work.",claude-sonnet-4,descr,"In an attempt to inject some positivity into their feedback, many managers rely on sandwiching negative feedback between two positive comments.

The music sounds happy and catchy, but the words tell sad stories about the American dream - the idea that anyone can become successful in America. Many songs are about ordinary working people who struggle in life and feel angry because they don't get rich or famous. The song Glory Days, for example, is about people in a small town who remember when they were young and felt like anything was possible. Downbound Train tells the story of a young man whose life falls apart when he loses his job.

The objects that our early human ancestors left behind don't tell us how well they could speak. However, we can see one important thing in the bones of early humans - how their mouth, throat and tongue developed. About 100,000 years ago, humans had developed the ability to make complex sounds.

They're so busy communicating that they never experience the feeling of solitude and run the risk of not learning how to enjoy their own company. In addition, they're learning conversation through messages that can be edited and changed at the expense of learning the art of real conversation in real time with the person in front of you."
120-b1,"Don't always give negative feedback after positive feedback. When good and bad comments always come together, people stop believing the good comments and ignore them. Make sure you sometimes give positive feedback by itself, and don't always feel you need to add criticism or suggestions for improvement.",claude-sonnet-4,descr_ex,"Don't always follow positive feedback with negative feedback. When positive and negative feedback always appear to go hand in hand, the positives can become devalued and ignored. Ensure there are times when positive feedback is given for its own sake and resist the temptation to offer constructive criticism."
