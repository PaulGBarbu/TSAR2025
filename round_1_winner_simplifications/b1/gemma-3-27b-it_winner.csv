Dreams can tell you things about yourself that you don’t even know you’re thinking about. Many people have similar dreams, like flying, falling, losing teeth, or being naked in public. These dreams probably have a similar meaning for most people. However, to understand what your dreams mean *to you*, you need to think about what’s happening in your life and how you’re feeling. Connecting your dreams to your everyday experiences is the most important thing.



",gemma-3-27b-it,descr_ex,"Your dreams might show you all kinds of insights into things that you didn't realise you were thinking about. Common dreams like being able to fly or falling, your teeth falling out or having no clothes on in a public place probably mean something similar in most people. But the key to understanding exactly what they mean to you is to connect them to the events and feelings in your daily life."

The wild dogs in Moscow are a fascinating example of animals living in a city. There are about 35,000 wild dogs living on the streets of Moscow. Some were born in the wild, but others used to have owners who left them. Some dogs live by themselves, and others live in groups called packs.

In 2010, scientists studied these dogs and discovered they have adapted very well to living in the city. They’ve learned it’s safer to cross roads with people, and some even seem to know what traffic lights mean. (Traffic lights are the coloured lights that control traffic – red means stop, green means go.)",gemma-3-27b-it,descr_ex,"One of the most interesting cases of wild animals living in a city are the wild dogs of Moscow.

Cape Town can be a dangerous place for baboons. Some have been hurt or killed by cars, and others have died after touching electric cables. Baboons are an endangered species, which means there are not many left, so it’s important to protect them. To help the baboons and reduce problems between them and people, the city council has hired people called Baboon Monitors. These monitors try to scare baboons away from towns and cities, or they catch them and move them to the countryside. This plan has worked sometimes, but it’s difficult to stop baboons from returning to the city because they find food there easily.

I work for a big computer company, but the main office is in the USA. So, I do all my work online from my home. This means I don’t lose time travelling to work or talking about unimportant things with people I work with. I work on different projects, and I like that I can change my work schedule easily. For example, I can take time off to go to my children’s school events or go to the dentist. However, there’s a bad side too.

People living in Berlin, Germany were upset because the city was shooting wild pigs, and they thought it was cruel. Hunters and people who love animals argued about this. 

Because of these protests, the city council decided to try a kinder way to control the pigs. Now, instead of shooting them, they are building fences to keep the pigs in certain areas. It is also now against the law to give food to the pigs. 

It’s not yet clear if this new plan will work. It might be difficult because the weather is getting warmer, which means more pigs are surviving the winter and the number of pigs is increasing.

Suzanne Collins, the author of *The Hunger Games*, was inspired by ancient Greek myths – traditional stories from ancient Greece. One of her favourite stories when she was young was about Theseus and the Minotaur. 

In this story, the city of Athens was controlled by Crete. The people of Athens fought back, and as a punishment, the king of Crete, Minos, made them send seven young men and seven young women to Crete every year. These young people were sent into a complicated maze called a labyrinth, where a monster called the Minotaur would eat them.

Zoos can help people learn about protecting animals and their homes. By showing animals to the public, zoos can teach us why it’s important to save them. Some zoos also give a safe home to animals that have been hurt or treated badly, like those from circuses or pets people don’t want anymore.

A new idea is becoming popular that goes against buying a lot of things – it’s called ‘buy nothing’. It started in Canada in the early 1990s and then became popular in the US.

George Lucas was one of the first film directors to use a popular story structure called the “hero’s journey”. This structure has 17 main parts. Usually, the hero is a normal person at the start of the story. Then, something happens that encourages them to go on an adventure and their life changes. 

In the beginning of *Star Wars*, Luke Skywalker lives a normal life with his aunt and uncle, fixing robots.

One idea to protect Earth from a potentially hazardous asteroid (PHA) is to destroy it with a nuclear weapon. This might sound like something from a movie – like the film *Armageddon* from 1998 – but NASA actually has a real plan called HAMMER (Hypervelocity Asteroid Mitigation Mission for Emergency Response).

The plan involves launching rockets, weighing eight tons, at an asteroid that is coming towards Earth. The idea is to gently push the asteroid and change its direction. If the asteroid is very close, the rockets would carry nuclear bombs to explode and break it apart.

Campbell says that heroes usually don’t want to start their adventure at first. But then, someone older and wiser – a mentor – helps them and encourages them to begin. This is when the hero enters a new and different world where the adventure takes place. 

In this new world, the hero has to prove themselves by completing difficult tasks, fighting bad guys, and making new friends. All of this prepares them for their biggest challenge. 

For example, in Star Wars, Obi-Wan Kenobi is the mentor who helps Luke Skywalker. Han Solo and the robots R2D2 and C3PO become Luke’s friends. And Darth Vader is the main enemy, who Luke faces inside the Death Star – which is the ‘special world’ in this story.

The other idea was different. It said that dreams aren’t important messages. Instead, they are just what happens when our brain is busy sorting out memories and things that happened during the day.

Companies are realising they can make a lot of money from the “sharing economy”. This means finding ways to profit from things that people aren’t using fully. 

A popular business idea is for companies to create websites or apps that connect customers with people who offer a service or product. These companies don’t directly provide the service themselves – they simply connect the people who need it with the people who can offer it.

For example, Airbnb is a company that helps people rent out spare rooms or houses. This allows people to earn money from property they aren’t using all the time. Uber is another example. It allows people to use their own cars to give rides to others and earn money. They work like taxis, but use regular people’s cars instead of professional taxi drivers.



",gemma-3-27b-it,descr,"Businesses have caught on to the profitability of the sharing economy and are seeking to gain from making use of those underutilised resources. A business model that has rapidly risen in popularity sees companies providing an online platform that puts customers in contact with those who can provide a particular product or service. Companies like Airbnb act as a middleman for people to cash in on their unused rooms and houses and let them out as lucrative accommodation. Another example is Uber, which encourages people to use their own personal cars as taxis to make some extra cash in their free time."

Breeding programmes in zoos help with this problem. Animals born in zoos can be released back into the wild, which helps to create more genetic diversity – meaning a wider variety of genes within the population. This makes the species stronger and more likely to survive.



",gemma-3-27b-it,descr,"One of the most important modern functions of zoos is supporting international breeding programmes, particularly for endangered species. In the wild, some of the rarest species have difficulty in finding mates and breeding, and they might also be threatened by poachers, loss of their habitat and predators. A good zoo will enable these species to live and breed in a secure environment. In addition, as numbers of some wild species drop, there is an increased danger of populations becoming too genetically similar. Breeding programmes provide a safeguard: zoo-bred animals can be released into the wild to increase genetic diversity."

These kinds of accidents are very rare, but both boats and trains can cause a bridge to fall down. Trains can cause a collapse because of how fast they are moving when they hit the bridge. Boats, however, are very heavy. Even if a boat is moving slowly, its weight can cause a bridge to collapse. 

The best way to prevent these accidents is to be prepared. We can use new technology to find problems with the bridge’s structure – that is, how it is built. Also, making sure workers are safe and designing bridges better can help to avoid these terrible accidents.



",gemma-3-27b-it,descr,"Both of these kinds of accidents are extremely rare, but boats and trains can cause a bridge to collapse for different reasons. With trains, it's the velocity of the impact that can bring a bridge down.

Modern technologies that can detect structural weakness, safer working environments and better designs can all help to reduce these terrible accidents."

The rover regularly checks the air on Mars. In 2014, it discovered methane in the air. Methane is a simple organic molecule – it’s a chemical made of carbon, which is found in all living things. It’s also a main part of natural gas, which we use for heating and cooking.

Methane doesn’t stay in the air for very long – usually only a few hundred years. This means something on Mars must be creating more of it. NASA says Mars releases a lot of methane, thousands of tons at a time. The amount of methane in the air changes with the seasons, going up and down, almost like the planet is breathing.

They believed they could get better at things if they tried. Dweck calls this a ‘growth mindset’ – meaning they think about what they can achieve in the future. 

However, other children reacted differently. They thought the puzzles were testing how clever they already were, and they felt bad when they couldn’t solve them. Dweck calls this a ‘fixed mindset’ – meaning they believed their abilities couldn’t be improved. Some of these children even said they might cheat next time.

It can seem like the world is becoming more violent, but there is also some good news. After World War II, until 1990, there were 30 wars where over 100,000 people died in each one. Today, we still have conflicts within countries (called civil wars), but generally, countries are getting along better than before. 

However, there has been more terrorism recently. Also, since World War II, more ordinary people (civilians) have died in wars than soldiers. 

But even when we look at deaths of civilians, things aren’t completely negative. You are nine times more likely to die from a regular crime than from a war. In fact, the number of murders around the world has even gone down a little. It fell from 8 murders for every 100,000 people in 2000, to about 5.3 murders for every 100,000 people in 2015.

The answer is often to prevent the characters from using their phones! It’s common in horror films that when the main character really needs to call for help, they have no signal.

Most spiders have venom, but they use it to catch animals for food, not to hurt people. Only around 25 types of spiders have venom that is dangerous to humans. 

Although a spider bite can be painful, it’s very rarely life-threatening. In Australia, the Sydney funnel-web spider used to be very dangerous, but no one has died from its bite since 1981, when scientists created an anti-venom (a medicine to stop the venom’s effect).

Be careful with hairy spiders like tarantulas. If they feel scared, they will defend themselves by shooting out tiny hairs that can cause irritation. These hairs can get into your skin or eyes and make them uncomfortable.



",gemma-3-27b-it,descr,"Spider venom is present in most species and serves the purpose of stunning or killing their prey rather than attacking humans. In fact, only 25 of the known spider species produce venom which can actually harm humans, and although spider bites can be painful, they are rarely deadly. Australia's notorious Sydney funnel-web spider has not produced any fatalities since anti-venom was developed in 1981. However, take care not to rub hairy spiders like tarantulas up the wrong way. When they feel in danger, they defend themselves by ejecting a cloud of urticating hairs. These irritating hairs then embed themselves in the skin or eyes of the attacker."

This scary movie idea was very common in horror films made in the late 1900s. It usually begins with a group of teenagers having fun, but then they all die – except for one girl. 

At the start of the film, this girl is often quiet, innocent and not very confident. But by the end, she becomes very strong and clever. She almost always survives and defeats the killer. This surviving girl is often called “the final girl”.



",gemma-3-27b-it,descr,"This horror film cliché was especially popular with horror films of the late 20th century. It starts with a group of teenagers all enjoying themselves, and it ends with everyone dead except one girl. At the beginning the girl is usually innocent, shy and not particularly strong. By the end, she has become the toughest and most resourceful person in the world. The last girl almost always wins in the end."

To understand how humans developed the ability to use complicated language, we need to study our brains and how they differ from those of other animals. It’s not just about the size of the brain, but also what it can *do*, and *when* and *why* these abilities developed over time – this is called evolution.

Unfortunately, it’s hard to find evidence from the past. Objects left by our ancestors don’t show us how well they could speak. However, we *can* see changes in the mouths, throats, and tongues of early humans in their remains. 

Around 100,000 years ago, humans could already make complex sounds. Before that time, scientists who study evolution (called evolutionary biologists) can only make educated guesses about how early humans communicated – perhaps they used simpler sounds.



",gemma-3-27b-it,descr,"If we want to know where our capability for complex language came from, we need to look at how our brains are different from other animals. This relates to more than just brain size; it is important what other things our brains can do and when and why they evolved that way. And for this there are very few physical clues; artefacts left by our ancestors don't tell us what speech they were capable of making. One thing we can see in the remains of early humans, however, is the development of the mouth, throat and tongue. By about 100,000 years ago, humans had evolved the ability to create complex sounds. Before that, evolutionary biologists can only guess whether or not early humans communicated using more basic sounds."

It’s not natural for girls to prefer subjects like art and literature – society teaches them to. We are often told that boys are better at subjects like maths and physics. Also, young people don’t often see women working in science jobs. 

Often, in cartoons and stories, scientists, inventors, and astronauts are shown as men. There’s also a wrong idea that scientists are strange, not very social, or work alone. These ideas come from TV, films and other media. 

Because of these ideas, girls might not think science is a job for them, and they might not want to study it. If girls had more examples of successful women in science, they would feel more confident and like they belong in these subjects. This would encourage more girls to choose science as a career.



**Note:** *Stereotypes* are oversimplified and often untrue ideas about groups of people. In this text, they refer to false beliefs about scientists. *Role models* are people we admire and look up to.",gemma-3-27b-it,descr,"It is society, not nature, that tells us girls should favour arts and humanities and leave maths and physics to the boys. Coupled with this is the lack of positive female role models youngsters see doing science-related jobs. Cartoons and stories often show the crazy scientist, genius inventor, or adventurous astronaut as a man. Furthermore, there is an unfortunate perception that scientists are geeky, have poor social skills or that their work is lonely and detached from the rest of the world. These are false stereotypes portrayed by the media, but they may mean that girls do not identify with scientists, and see science as an unappealing career path. If girls saw more positive female role models in science it would give them more confidence and a greater sense of belonging in those subjects."

The Scallion is a student newspaper that comes out every week. It’s free and you can find it in buildings around the university. About 10,000 students read it. Students write and make the newspaper themselves.

A recent survey showed that students and staff like the newspaper a lot. They enjoy it for fun, to learn about different cultures, and to get experience for future jobs. 

However, printing the newspaper costs a lot of money. Also, not all students can easily get a copy because they have to go to the university to pick one up. Finally, many newspapers are thrown away on campus, which is bad for the environment.



",gemma-3-27b-it,descr,"The Scallion is printed weekly and distributed free in faculty buildings, with a readership of approximately 10,000 students. It is written and produced entirely by students. The survey shows that the newspaper is highly valued by university students and staff for entertainment, cultural enrichment and work experience. The cost of printing newspapers is significant. Furthermore, some students do not have easy access to the paper, since the only way to obtain a copy is to physically go to university. An additional environmental issue is that a large number of copies end up as litter on campus."

At Girox Foods, about 12 out of every 100 employees leave their jobs each year. This percentage might not seem like a lot, but the average for companies in our industry is 7 out of 100. This report will look into why our employees are leaving and what makes them feel connected to their work. Based on what we find, we will suggest ways to make working at Girox Foods better, so we can keep our employees for longer. 

*(‘Employee turnover’ means the rate at which employees leave a company and are replaced. ‘Employee retention’ means keeping employees working at a company for a long time.)*



",gemma-3-27b-it,descr,"At Girox Foods, we are experiencing an annual employee turnover of about 12 per cent. Although this might not seem high at first glance, the industry standard is seven per cent. The principal objective of this report is to investigate the causes of employee engagement within the firm and, based on those, offer recommendations to improve the employees' experience of the workplace and increase employee retention."

What the speaker said made a lot of sense to me. I really think we might feel more alone even though we are more connected with each other through technology. 

I don’t think this is a big problem for people my age. We grew up without always having phones and the internet, so we’re used to being by ourselves. And we know that being alone is perfectly fine. 

But it’s different for younger people – those under 20. They spend so much time talking to people online that they don’t often feel truly alone. This means they might not learn how to be happy when they are on their own. Also, they are learning to have conversations by writing messages, where they can change things before sending them. This is different from talking to someone directly, which is a skill in itself – learning to speak naturally and respond quickly.



",gemma-3-27b-it,descr,"So much of what the speaker said rang true. I honestly believe there's a danger that the more connected we are, the more isolated we feel. I don't think this is such an issue for my generation who've lived without technology for so long. We know how to be alone and, more importantly, we know that it's OK to be alone. But the under 20s are another kettle of fish. They're so busy communicating that they never experience the feeling of solitude and run the risk of not learning how to enjoy their own company. In addition, they're learning conversation through messages that can be edited and changed at the expense of learning the art of real conversation in real time with the person in front of you."
120-b1,"Don’t always give criticism right after praise. If you always say something positive and then something negative, the good things you say might not seem important anymore. People might stop listening to the positive comments. Make sure to sometimes give praise without also giving advice on how to improve. It’s good to resist – or avoid – the urge to always point out what someone could do better.

**(Explanation: Constructive criticism means advice that is given to help someone improve.)**



",gemma-3-27b-it,descr,"Don't always follow positive feedback with negative feedback. When positive and negative feedback always appear to go hand in hand, the positives can become devalued and ignored. Ensure there are times when positive feedback is given for its own sake and resist the temptation to offer constructive criticism."
