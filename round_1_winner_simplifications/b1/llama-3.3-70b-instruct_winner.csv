Some common dreams, like flying, falling, losing your teeth, or being naked in public, might have similar meanings for most people.

Some of these dogs were born wild, while others were once pets that people did not want anymore. Some dogs live alone, and others live in groups. In 2010, scientists studied these dogs and found that they have adapted very well to city life.

Baboons are in danger of disappearing, so to protect them and reduce problems between humans and baboons, the city has hired a team of Baboon Monitors.

This is good because I don't waste time travelling to work or talking to colleagues about things that aren't important. I work on individual projects, and I like the freedom that comes with it. It means I can take time off when my kids have school events or when I need to go to the dentist.

Some artists wanted to make people think about important issues like war, inequality, and unfair treatment, so they created art with strong messages.

The city council listened to the complaints and decided to try a more peaceful approach. They put up fences to keep the pigs away and made a rule that it's not allowed to feed them.

You don't need a lot of friends, but you do need someone to have a deep conversation with, as well as other friends to socialize with.

Many people praise others for their natural abilities, saying things like 'You're really good at paying attention to details' or 'You're a natural at organising events'. But research shows that if we praise the way people work and try to solve problems, rather than just their natural abilities, we can help them develop new skills and get even better at things they are already good at.

Nowadays, although there are still some civil wars, most countries are living together more peacefully than they used to. Unfortunately, terrorist attacks have increased in recent years. Also, since World War II, more civilians (ordinary people, not soldiers) have been killed in wars than soldiers. Despite this, the situation for civilians is not entirely negative. While it's true that people are more likely to die as a result of violent crime (like robbery or assault) than because of war or political conflict, the number of murders worldwide has actually decreased. In 2000, about 8 out of every 100,000 people were murdered, but by 2015, this number had fallen to around 5.3 per 100,000 people.",llama-3.3-70b-instruct,descr,"As for news stories that make us think the world is an increasingly violent place, there is cause for some optimism too.

Furthermore, there is an unfortunate perception that scientists are geeky, have poor social skills or that their work is lonely and detached from the rest of the world. These are false stereotypes portrayed by the media, but they may mean that girls do not identify with scientists, and see science as an unappealing career path. If girls saw more positive female role models in science it would give them more confidence and a greater sense of belonging in those subjects."
117-b1,"The Scallion is a newspaper that comes out every week and is given out for free in university buildings. About 10,000 students read it. Students write and produce the whole newspaper themselves. A survey shows that students and staff at the university really value the newspaper for fun, learning about culture, and getting work experience. However, printing the newspaper is expensive. Also, some students can't easily get a copy because they have to physically go to the university to get one. Another problem is that many copies are thrown away and become litter on campus, which is bad for the environment.",llama-3.3-70b-instruct,descr_ex,"The Scallion is printed weekly and distributed free in faculty buildings, with a readership of approximately 10,000 students. It is written and produced entirely by students. The survey shows that the newspaper is highly valued by university students and staff for entertainment, cultural enrichment and work experience. The cost of printing newspapers is significant. Furthermore, some students do not have easy access to the paper, since the only way to obtain a copy is to physically go to university. An additional environmental issue is that a large number of copies end up as litter on campus."
118-b1,"At Girox Foods, around 12% of our employees leave the company every year. This is higher than the average for our industry, which is 7%.

119-b1,"I think the speaker made some very good points. I really believe that the more we're connected to others through technology, the more alone we can feel. I don't think this is a big problem for people my age, who grew up without all this technology. We're used to being alone and we know it's okay to have time to ourselves. But for people under 20, it's different. They're always messaging and never really get to experience being alone, which can make it hard for them to learn how to be happy with just their own company. Also, they're learning how to talk to people through messages, which they can edit and change before sending. This means they might not learn how to have real conversations, face-to-face, in the moment, which is an important skill.",llama-3.3-70b-instruct,descr,"So much of what the speaker said rang true. I honestly believe there's a danger that the more connected we are, the more isolated we feel. I don't think this is such an issue for my generation who've lived without technology for so long. We know how to be alone and, more importantly, we know that it's OK to be alone. But the under 20s are another kettle of fish. They're so busy communicating that they never experience the feeling of solitude and run the risk of not learning how to enjoy their own company. In addition, they're learning conversation through messages that can be edited and changed at the expense of learning the art of real conversation in real time with the person in front of you."
120-b1,"Don't always follow good comments with bad comments. If you always give both good and bad comments together, people might start to ignore the good ones. Make sure to sometimes only give good comments, without adding any criticism. This way, people will appreciate the good comments more.",llama-3.3-70b-instruct,descr,"Don't always follow positive feedback with negative feedback. When positive and negative feedback always appear to go hand in hand, the positives can become devalued and ignored. Ensure there are times when positive feedback is given for its own sake and resist the temptation to offer constructive criticism."
