21-b1,"Your dreams can give you clues about thoughts you didn’t know you had. Many people have similar dreams, such as flying, falling, losing teeth, or being naked in public. These dreams usually mean something similar for most people. But to understand exactly what a dream means for you, you need to connect it to the events and feelings in your everyday life.",gpt-oss-120b,descr_ex,"Your dreams might show you all kinds of insights into things that you didn't realise you were thinking about.

22-b1,"One of the most interesting examples of wild animals living in a city is the wild dogs of Moscow. In Moscow there are about 35,000 wild dogs on the streets. Some dogs were born in the wild, and some are pets that people left behind. Some dogs live alone, while others live in groups. In 2010 scientists studied the dogs and found that they have adapted very well to city life.

25-b1,"Cape Town can be a risky place for baboons. Some have been hurt or killed in car crashes, and others have been electrocuted (hurt by electricity) when they played with electric wires. Baboons are an endangered species (they are at risk of disappearing). To protect them and lower problems between people and baboons, the city council hired a group of Baboon Monitors.

27-b1,"In the 1990s, graffiti was still common, but street art grew a lot all over the world. Some artists wanted to send political messages, so they made art that made people think about war, unfairness (inequality) and discrimination (treating people badly because of their race, gender, etc.). Other street artists cared more about creating pretty and attractive pictures.

30-b1,"Many people who live in Berlin, Germany said that shooting pigs is too cruel, and there were strong arguments between hunters and animal lovers. After the protests, the city council (the group that makes decisions for the city) chose a calmer way to deal with the pigs.

Time will tell if this strategy works, though it may be a losing battle as warmer winters mean that pig numbers are greater than in the past."
31-b1,"A big idea for the *Hunger Games* book comes from Suzanne’s love of old Greek myths (stories from ancient Greece).

As a punishment, Minos, the king of Crete, makes the Athenians send seven boys and seven girls to Crete every year. The young people are put into a labyrinth (a huge maze) where a monster called the Minotaur lives and eats them. One of the youths, named Theseus, fights the Minotaur and kills it.

33-b1,"A new movement is growing that goes against buying a lot – the “buy nothing” movement. It started in Canada in the early 1990s and later spread to the United States. There it became a way to say no to the big spending and buying too much on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, which happen at the end of Thanksgiving.

36-b1,"Most people have four to six dreams each night after they are ten years old. That means they have about 2,000 dreams every year.

They also have at least one person they can share personal feelings with – this is called self‑disclosure (talking openly about your inner thoughts). One close person, together with a wider circle of other friends, is enough. It is not enough to have many friends only for activities or to talk about music or football.

Many people usually praise the final result and what seems to be natural talent, for example: “You have a good eye for details” or “You are really good at planning events.” But research shows that if we praise the way a person works – the effort they put in, trying new ideas, and the ways they solve problems – we help them build new abilities and keep improving their talents.",gpt-oss-120b,descr,"Psychologist and 'growth mindset' proponent Carol Dweck spoke of the plasticity of the brain and our ability to develop skills and talents that we might not have been good at to start with.

However, research suggests that by focusing on the process of how things are done – praising effort, experimentation and problem-solving strategies – we can encourage the development of new skills and the continued honing of talents."
