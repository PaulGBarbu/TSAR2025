<p align="center">Simple description of what your project do or how to use it</p>

This repository contains the data which was generated for the TSAR 2025 Shared Task Competition.

---

**TL;DR:** We tested seven models and three prompts to simplify text to CEFR levels A2 and B1. We employed an LLM-as-a-Judge model to identify the best simplifications. The benefit of using an LLM-as-a-Judge system is that the judge can detect errors that traditional methods fail to address. For example, some simplifications omit important key information, while others add helpful explanations that improve readability.

This repository contains all the data that was generated and mentioned in the paper. If you're just interested in the final submitted dataset, that's in the `submission_dataset.jsonl` file.

The folder `simplifications` contains all the simplifications generated by all seven models; the prompt is denoted by the filename.

The folder `round_1_judge_results` contains the judgments made by the LLMs on the simplifications and their rankings. Here, the three prompts competed against each other within each model. For ease of access, there is also the `round_1_winner_simplifications` folder, which contains only the winning simplifications.

The folder `round_2_judge_results` follows the same structure as round 1, but here the seven models competed against each other.
