In addition, as numbers of some wild species drop, there is an increased danger of populations becoming too genetically similar. Breeding programmes provide a safeguard: zoo-bred animals can be released into the wild to increase genetic diversity.",B1,"
Today, zoos play a key role in helping to protect animals, especially those that are becoming rare. Some endangered animals struggle to find partners and have babies in the wild, and they face dangers like hunters, habitat loss and animals that hunt them. Zoos offer a safe place for these animals to live and breed. Also, when there are very few of a particular animal left, they can become too similar genetically, which is not healthy. Breeding programmes in zoos help with this – animals born in zoos can be reintroduced into the wild to create a healthier, more diverse population.

With trains, it's the velocity of the impact that can bring a bridge down. With boats, it's the very large mass they have that can bring about the collapse, even if they are moving very slowly when it occurs. The best way to avoid bridge failures is to plan for them. Modern technologies that can detect structural weakness, safer working environments and better designs can all help to reduce these terrible accidents.",B1,"
These accidents are very rare, but boats and trains can both cause bridges to fall down. Trains are dangerous because they move very fast. Boats are dangerous because they are very heavy, even if they move slowly. We can help prevent these accidents by checking bridges for problems, making work safer, and building stronger bridges.

By the end, she has become the toughest and most resourceful person in the world. The last girl almost always wins in the end.",B1,"
This scary film idea was very common in horror movies made in the late 1900s. It usually begins with a group of young people having fun, but they all die except for one girl. At first, this girl is often quiet, shy, and not very strong. But by the end, she becomes very brave and clever. Usually, this last girl survives.

tsar2025testblind,115-b1,"If we want to know where our capability for complex language came from, we need to look at how our brains are different from other animals. This relates to more than just brain size; it is important what other things our brains can do and when and why they evolved that way. And for this there are very few physical clues; artefacts left by our ancestors don't tell us what speech they were capable of making. One thing we can see in the remains of early humans, however, is the development of the mouth, throat and tongue. By about 100,000 years ago, humans had evolved the ability to create complex sounds. Before that, evolutionary biologists can only guess whether or not early humans communicated using more basic sounds.",B1,"
To understand how humans developed complex language, we need to study the human brain and how it differs from those of other animals. It’s not just about brain size, but also about what our brains *can do* and *why* these abilities developed. Unfortunately, it’s hard to find evidence – objects from our ancestors don’t show us how they spoke. However, we can see changes in the mouths, throats and tongues of early humans. Around 100,000 years ago, humans could make complex sounds. Before that time, scientists can only make educated guesses about how early humans communicated – perhaps with simpler sounds.

tsar2025testblind,116-b1,"It is society, not nature, that tells us girls should favour arts and humanities and leave maths and physics to the boys. Coupled with this is the lack of positive female role models youngsters see doing science-related jobs. Cartoons and stories often show the crazy scientist, genius inventor, or adventurous astronaut as a man. Furthermore, there is an unfortunate perception that scientists are geeky, have poor social skills or that their work is lonely and detached from the rest of the world. These are false stereotypes portrayed by the media, but they may mean that girls do not identify with scientists, and see science as an unappealing career path. If girls saw more positive female role models in science it would give them more confidence and a greater sense of belonging in those subjects.",B1,"
Society, not nature, often encourages girls to study subjects like art and languages, and boys to study maths and science. There aren’t many famous female scientists that young people see, and stories often show scientists as men. Also, people sometimes think scientists are strange or don’t have many friends, which isn’t true. These ideas in the media can make science seem less interesting to girls, and make them feel they don’t belong. If girls had more female scientists to look up to, they might feel more confident and want to study these subjects.

tsar2025testblind,117-b1,"The Scallion is printed weekly and distributed free in faculty buildings, with a readership of approximately 10,000 students. It is written and produced entirely by students. The survey shows that the newspaper is highly valued by university students and staff for entertainment, cultural enrichment and work experience. The cost of printing newspapers is significant. Furthermore, some students do not have easy access to the paper, since the only way to obtain a copy is to physically go to university. An additional environmental issue is that a large number of copies end up as litter on campus.",B1,"The Scallion is a student newspaper printed every week. About 10,000 students read it, and students write and make it. People at the university like it for fun, learning, and getting work experience. Printing the newspaper costs a lot of money. Also, it’s not easy for all students to get a copy – they have to go to the university to pick one up. Finally, many newspapers are thrown away and become litter on campus, which is bad for the environment.

tsar2025testblind,119-b1,"So much of what the speaker said rang true. I honestly believe there's a danger that the more connected we are, the more isolated we feel. I don't think this is such an issue for my generation who've lived without technology for so long. We know how to be alone and, more importantly, we know that it's OK to be alone. But the under 20s are another kettle of fish. They're so busy communicating that they never experience the feeling of solitude and run the risk of not learning how to enjoy their own company. In addition, they're learning conversation through messages that can be edited and changed at the expense of learning the art of real conversation in real time with the person in front of you.",B1,"I really agreed with a lot of what the speaker said. I think it’s possible that being very connected online can actually make people feel lonely. I don’t think this is a big problem for people my age, because we grew up without always having technology. We’re used to being alone, and we know that’s okay. But younger people, under 20, are different. They spend so much time talking to people online that they don’t often feel truly alone, and they might not learn to enjoy being by themselves. Also, they’re learning to have conversations by writing messages, which you can change before sending. This means they might not get good at talking to people face-to-face in real time.

tsar2025testblind,120-b1,"Don't always follow positive feedback with negative feedback. When positive and negative feedback always appear to go hand in hand, the positives can become devalued and ignored. Ensure there are times when positive feedback is given for its own sake and resist the temptation to offer constructive criticism.",B1,"
Don’t always say something negative after something positive. If you always give both good and bad feedback together, people might not notice or appreciate the good things. Sometimes, just give positive feedback – and don’t feel you always need to offer advice for improvement.
