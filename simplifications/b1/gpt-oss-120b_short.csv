This relates to more than just brain size; it is important what other things our brains can do and when and why they evolved that way. And for this there are very few physical clues; artefacts left by our ancestors don't tell us what speech they were capable of making. One thing we can see in the remains of early humans, however, is the development of the mouth, throat and tongue. By about 100,000 years ago, humans had evolved the ability to create complex sounds. Before that, evolutionary biologists can only guess whether or not early humans communicated using more basic sounds.",B1,"If we want to know where our ability to use complex language comes from, we have to look at how our brains are different from other animals. It is not only about brain size; we also need to think about what our brains can do and why they changed in the past. There are very few physical clues. The tools left by our ancestors do not show what kind of speech they could make. One clue is the shape of the mouth, throat, and tongue that we can see in early human remains. By about 100,000 years ago, humans had learned to make complex sounds. Before that, scientists can only guess whether early humans used only simple sounds.",openai/gpt-oss-120b,gpt-oss-120b_short,B1_PROMPT_SHORT,B1
tsar2025testblind,116-b1,"It is society, not nature, that tells us girls should favour arts and humanities and leave maths and physics to the boys. Coupled with this is the lack of positive female role models youngsters see doing science-related jobs. Cartoons and stories often show the crazy scientist, genius inventor, or adventurous astronaut as a man. Furthermore, there is an unfortunate perception that scientists are geeky, have poor social skills or that their work is lonely and detached from the rest of the world. These are false stereotypes portrayed by the media, but they may mean that girls do not identify with scientists, and see science as an unappealing career path. If girls saw more positive female role models in science it would give them more confidence and a greater sense of belonging in those subjects.",B1,"It is society, not nature, that says girls should like arts and humanities and leave maths and physics to boys.

It is written and produced entirely by students. The survey shows that the newspaper is highly valued by university students and staff for entertainment, cultural enrichment and work experience. The cost of printing newspapers is significant. Furthermore, some students do not have easy access to the paper, since the only way to obtain a copy is to physically go to university. An additional environmental issue is that a large number of copies end up as litter on campus.",B1,"The Scallion is printed every week and given for free in faculty buildings.

I don't think this is such an issue for my generation who've lived without technology for so long. We know how to be alone and, more importantly, we know that it's OK to be alone. But the under 20s are another kettle of fish. They're so busy communicating that they never experience the feeling of solitude and run the risk of not learning how to enjoy their own company. In addition, they're learning conversation through messages that can be edited and changed at the expense of learning the art of real conversation in real time with the person in front of you.",B1,"A lot of what the speaker said felt true.
