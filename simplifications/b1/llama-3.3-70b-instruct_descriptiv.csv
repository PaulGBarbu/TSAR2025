So, maybe you can turn a nightmare into a safe-feeling dream, or you can direct the plot of your dream like a film director. Then, instead of just working out the meaning of your dreams, you'll be creating them, though you might want to continue having some dreams that allow your subconscious to tell you what's on your mind!

This means you can change a bad dream into a good one, or decide what happens next, like a director of a movie. Instead of just trying to understand your dreams, you can create them. However, it's still a good idea to have some dreams that can help you understand what's going on in your mind, without controlling them.
