A good zoo gives these animals a safe place to live and have babies. Also, when there are fewer animals in the wild, the ones that are left can become too similar in their genes, which is not good.

People today live longer, healthier, and happier lives with more freedom. The real problem, Pinker says, is that the ideas of reason and science from the Enlightenment are being attacked.

Mobile phones have made that situation a bit less believable now. What's the solution to maintain suspense? No phone coverage! If you're a hero in a horror film, it's almost certain that at a key moment, just when you absolutely need to call for help, you will not have any coverage at all. Or your phone battery will die just as you are making the call. Or both.",B1,"In old scary movies, when the main characters were in big trouble, they couldn’t call for help or call the police.

If you’re the hero in a horror movie, you can be sure that at the worst moment, when you really need to call for help, your phone won’t work.

And now it's happening again to Big Mike's successor – the Cavendish. With its easily transported, thick-skinned and sweet-tasting fruit, the Gros Michel banana plant dominated the plantations of Central America. United Fruit, the main grower and exporter in South America at the time, mass-produced its bananas in the most efficient way possible: it cloned shoots from the stems of plants instead of growing plants from seeds, and cultivated them in densely packed fields.",B1,"In the 1950s, banana companies in Central America had a big problem. Their most popular banana, called the Gros Michel (or Big Mike), was dying. Now, the same thing is happening to the Cavendish banana, which replaced the Gros Michel.

The Gros Michel was very popular because it was easy to transport, had thick skin, and tasted sweet. It was grown on large farms in Central America. The main company, United Fruit, grew these bananas in a very efficient way. Instead of planting seeds, they used parts of the plant to make new ones. This way, they could grow many bananas close together in big fields.",mistralai/mistral-medium-3,mistral-medium-3_descriptive_w_example,B1_PROMPT_DESCRIPTIVE_EXAMPLE,B1

In fact, only 25 of the known spider species produce venom which can actually harm humans, and although spider bites can be painful, they are rarely deadly. Australia's notorious Sydney funnel-web spider has not produced any fatalities since anti-venom was developed in 1981. However, take care not to rub hairy spiders like tarantulas up the wrong way. When they feel in danger, they defend themselves by ejecting a cloud of urticating hairs. These irritating hairs then embed themselves in the skin or eyes of the attacker.",B1,"Most spiders have venom, but they use it to catch their food, not to hurt people. Only 25 types of spiders have venom that can harm humans. Even though spider bites can hurt, they are almost never deadly. For example, Australia’s dangerous Sydney funnel-web spider hasn’t caused any deaths since 1981, when a special medicine (anti-venom) was made.

But be careful with hairy spiders like tarantulas. If they feel scared, they protect themselves by shooting out tiny, irritating hairs. These hairs can stick to your skin or eyes and cause problems.",mistralai/mistral-medium-3,mistral-medium-3_descriptive_w_example,B1_PROMPT_DESCRIPTIVE_EXAMPLE,B1

This relates to more than just brain size; it is important what other things our brains can do and when and why they evolved that way. And for this there are very few physical clues; artefacts left by our ancestors don't tell us what speech they were capable of making. One thing we can see in the remains of early humans, however, is the development of the mouth, throat and tongue. By about 100,000 years ago, humans had evolved the ability to create complex sounds.

tsar2025testblind,116-b1,"It is society, not nature, that tells us girls should favour arts and humanities and leave maths and physics to the boys. Coupled with this is the lack of positive female role models youngsters see doing science-related jobs. Cartoons and stories often show the crazy scientist, genius inventor, or adventurous astronaut as a man. Furthermore, there is an unfortunate perception that scientists are geeky, have poor social skills or that their work is lonely and detached from the rest of the world. These are false stereotypes portrayed by the media, but they may mean that girls do not identify with scientists, and see science as an unappealing career path. If girls saw more positive female role models in science it would give them more confidence and a greater sense of belonging in those subjects.",B1,"People often say that girls should like arts and humanities, while boys should study maths and physics. This idea comes from society, not from nature. Another problem is that young people don’t see many women working in science jobs. In cartoons and stories, scientists, inventors, and astronauts are usually men. Also, many people think scientists are strange, not good at talking to others, or that they work alone. These ideas are not true, but they are often shown in the media. Because of this, girls may not feel connected to science and might not want to choose it as a career.
