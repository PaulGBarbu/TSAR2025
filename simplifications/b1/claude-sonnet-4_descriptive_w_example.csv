tsar2025testblind,107-b1,"A fast-paced, foot-tapping rock album, Born in the USA's lyrics nevertheless carry emotional weight. Behind the catchy rock melodies that drive these powerhouse classics are stories of the dark side of the American dream. Many tracks deal with the struggles of hard-working ordinary people and the bitterness and anger they feel as life doesn't bring them riches or glory. The song Glory Days, for example, is about people in a small town looking back at when they were young and had the world at their feet while Downbound Train tells the story of a young man whose life is ruined when he loses his job. It's not hard to imagine that the artist is channelling real people he knew and the life he might have had if he hadn't become a star. The album will leave you in no doubt of the unique and extraordinary talent of the Boss.",B1,"Born in the USA is a rock album with fast music that makes you want to move your feet. But the words of the songs have deep feelings. The songs sound happy and exciting, but they tell stories about the difficult parts of living in America. Many songs are about normal working people who have problems and feel angry because their lives don't give them money or success. For example, the song Glory Days is about people in a small town who remember when they were young and felt like they could do anything. Another song, Downbound Train, tells the story of a young man whose life goes wrong when he loses his job. You can easily think that the singer is writing about real people he knew and the life he could have had if he hadn't become famous. This album will show you clearly how special and amazing the Boss is as a musician.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4,claude-sonnet-4_descriptive_w_example,B1_PROMPT_DESCRIPTIVE_EXAMPLE,B1

During his expeditions, Lewis has witnessed this environmental destruction first-hand. He's swum over coral reefs bleached by the increase in water temperature, and observed underwater deserts beneath the shallow waters of the Red Sea, devoid of life and strewn with plastic. Pugh believes that nature can recover if it is given space to do so, but the clock is ticking. If we don't start looking after our seas, we may soon have an unsolvable problem on our hands.",B1,"Lewis wants to see more marine protected areas in the world. Right now, only 3 per cent of the ocean is protected, but he thinks this should be 10 per cent.

When Lewis travels to different places, he has seen this damage himself. He has swum over coral reefs that have lost their color because the water has become too warm. He has also seen underwater areas in the Red Sea that look like deserts - there are no fish or plants living there, and there is plastic everywhere. Lewis believes that nature can get better if we give it the chance, but we need to act quickly.

One thing we can see in the remains of early humans, however, is the development of the mouth, throat and tongue. By about 100,000 years ago, humans had evolved the ability to create complex sounds.

Furthermore, there is an unfortunate perception that scientists are geeky, have poor social skills or that their work is lonely and detached from the rest of the world.
