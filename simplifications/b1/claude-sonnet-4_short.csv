One thing we can see in the remains of early humans, however, is the development of the mouth, throat and tongue. By about 100,000 years ago, humans had evolved the ability to create complex sounds. Before that, evolutionary biologists can only guess whether or not early humans communicated using more basic sounds.",B1,"If we want to know where our ability for difficult language came from, we need to look at how our brains are different from other animals. This is about more than just brain size. It is important to know what other things our brains can do and when and why they changed that way. There are very few physical clues for this. Things left by our ancestors don't tell us what speech they could make. One thing we can see in the bones of early humans is how the mouth, throat and tongue developed. About 100,000 years ago, humans could make complex sounds. Before that, scientists can only guess if early humans talked using simpler sounds.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4,claude-sonnet-4_short,B1_PROMPT_SHORT,B1
tsar2025testblind,116-b1,"It is society, not nature, that tells us girls should favour arts and humanities and leave maths and physics to the boys. Coupled with this is the lack of positive female role models youngsters see doing science-related jobs. Cartoons and stories often show the crazy scientist, genius inventor, or adventurous astronaut as a man. Furthermore, there is an unfortunate perception that scientists are geeky, have poor social skills or that their work is lonely and detached from the rest of the world. These are false stereotypes portrayed by the media, but they may mean that girls do not identify with scientists, and see science as an unappealing career path. If girls saw more positive female role models in science it would give them more confidence and a greater sense of belonging in those subjects.",B1,"Society tells us that girls should like arts and leave maths and science to boys. Girls don't see many women doing science jobs. In cartoons and stories, scientists are usually men. People think scientists are strange and work alone. This is not true, but girls might not want to be scientists because of this. If girls saw more women scientists, they would feel more confident about science.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4,claude-sonnet-4_short,B1_PROMPT_SHORT,B1
tsar2025testblind,117-b1,"The Scallion is printed weekly and distributed free in faculty buildings, with a readership of approximately 10,000 students. It is written and produced entirely by students. The survey shows that the newspaper is highly valued by university students and staff for entertainment, cultural enrichment and work experience. The cost of printing newspapers is significant. Furthermore, some students do not have easy access to the paper, since the only way to obtain a copy is to physically go to university. An additional environmental issue is that a large number of copies end up as litter on campus.",B1,"The Scallion comes out every week and is free in university buildings. About 10,000 students read it. Students write and make the newspaper. A study shows that university students and workers like the newspaper because it is fun, teaches about culture, and gives work experience. Printing newspapers costs a lot of money. Also, some students cannot get the newspaper easily because they must go to the university to get it. Another problem is that many newspapers become trash on campus, which is bad for the environment.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4,claude-sonnet-4_short,B1_PROMPT_SHORT,B1

Although this might not seem high at first glance, the industry standard is seven per cent. The principal objective of this report is to investigate the causes of employee engagement within the firm and, based on those, offer recommendations to improve the employees' experience of the workplace and increase employee retention.",B1,"At Girox Foods, 12% of our workers leave every year. This number is not very high, but other companies in our industry only lose 7% of workers each year. This report will look at why workers are not happy at our company.

tsar2025testblind,119-b1,"So much of what the speaker said rang true. I honestly believe there's a danger that the more connected we are, the more isolated we feel. I don't think this is such an issue for my generation who've lived without technology for so long. We know how to be alone and, more importantly, we know that it's OK to be alone. But the under 20s are another kettle of fish. They're so busy communicating that they never experience the feeling of solitude and run the risk of not learning how to enjoy their own company. In addition, they're learning conversation through messages that can be edited and changed at the expense of learning the art of real conversation in real time with the person in front of you.",B1,"I agree with what the speaker said. I think when we use technology more, we can feel more alone. This isn't a big problem for older people like me. We lived without technology for many years. We know how to be alone and we know it's OK to be alone. But young people under 20 are different. They always communicate with their phones and never spend time alone. They don't learn to enjoy being by themselves. Also, they learn to talk through messages that they can change and edit. They don't learn how to have real conversations with people face to face.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4,claude-sonnet-4_short,B1_PROMPT_SHORT,B1

When positive and negative feedback always appear to go hand in hand, the positives can become devalued and ignored. Ensure there are times when positive feedback is given for its own sake and resist the temptation to offer constructive criticism.",B1,"Don't always give bad feedback after good feedback. When good and bad feedback always come together, people stop believing the good things you say. Sometimes just give good feedback on its own. Don't always add criticism.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4,claude-sonnet-4_short,B1_PROMPT_SHORT,B1
