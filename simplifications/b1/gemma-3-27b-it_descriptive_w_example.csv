Dreams can tell you things about yourself that you don’t even know you’re thinking about. Many people have similar dreams, like flying, falling, losing teeth, or being naked in public. These dreams probably have a similar meaning for most people. However, to understand what your dreams mean *to you*, you need to think about what’s happening in your life and how you’re feeling. Connecting your dreams to your everyday experiences is the most important thing.

Suzanne Collins, the author of The Hunger Games, was inspired by stories from ancient Greece when she wrote her book. When she was young, she especially loved the story of Theseus and the Minotaur. 

In this story, the city of Athens was controlled by Crete, but the people of Athens fought back. As a result, the king of Crete, Minos, made Athens send seven young men and seven young women to Crete each year. These young people were put in a complicated maze called a labyrinth, where a monster called the Minotaur would eat them. However, a young man named Theseus went into the labyrinth and killed the Minotaur. 

Suzanne Collins thinks of Katniss Everdeen, the main character in The Hunger Games, as a modern version of Theseus.

So, maybe you can turn a nightmare into a safe-feeling dream, or you can direct the plot of your dream like a film director. Then, instead of just working out the meaning of your dreams, you'll be creating them, though you might want to continue having some dreams that allow your subconscious to tell you what's on your mind!

Some people believe that writing down your dreams can help you have lucid dreams. Lucid dreams happen when you know you are dreaming while you’re in the dream, and you can even change what happens. For example, you could turn a scary dream into a happy one, or control the story of your dream like a director controls a movie. Instead of just trying to understand what your dreams mean, you can actually create them yourself!

Companies have realised that the ‘sharing economy’ can be very profitable, and they want to benefit from it by using things that are not being fully used. A popular business idea is for companies to create websites or apps that connect customers with people who can offer a service or product.

Uber is another example – it allows people to use their own cars as taxis and earn money when they have free time.

In the wild, some of the rarest species have difficulty in finding mates and breeding, and they might also be threatened by poachers, loss of their habitat and predators. A good zoo will enable these species to live and breed in a secure environment.

Breeding programmes provide a safeguard: zoo-bred animals can be released into the wild to increase genetic diversity.",B1,"
Today, zoos have a very important job: helping to breed animals, especially those that are becoming rare. In nature, it can be hard for these rare animals to find partners and have babies. They are also in danger from illegal hunting (poaching), losing their homes, and animals that hunt them. A good zoo keeps these animals safe so they can live and breed. Also, when there are very few of a certain animal left, they can become too similar genetically – meaning they don’t have enough differences in their genes. Breeding programmes help with this: animals born in zoos can be released back into the wild to make the animal population healthier and more diverse.

But research shows it’s better to praise the *way* someone does something.

Behind the catchy rock melodies that drive these powerhouse classics are stories of the dark side of the American dream. Many tracks deal with the struggles of hard-working ordinary people and the bitterness and anger they feel as life doesn't bring them riches or glory. The song Glory Days, for example, is about people in a small town looking back at when they were young and had the world at their feet while Downbound Train tells the story of a young man whose life is ruined when he loses his job. It's not hard to imagine that the artist is channelling real people he knew and the life he might have had if he hadn't become a star. The album will leave you in no doubt of the unique and extraordinary talent of the Boss.",B1,"
Born in the USA is a lively rock album that makes you want to move to the music, but the songs also have a lot of feeling. Although the songs sound energetic and exciting, they tell stories about the difficult side of life in America.

Many of the songs are about the problems of normal, working people and the sadness and anger they feel when life is hard and they don’t become rich or famous. For example, “Glory Days” is about people in a small town remembering their youth when they felt they could achieve anything. “Downbound Train” tells the story of a young man whose life is destroyed after he loses his job. 

You can easily believe the singer is writing about people he knew and imagining what his own life could have been like if he hadn’t become a successful musician. This album shows just how special and talented Bruce Springsteen, also known as ‘The Boss’, really is.

During his expeditions, Lewis has witnessed this environmental destruction first-hand. He's swum over coral reefs bleached by the increase in water temperature, and observed underwater deserts beneath the shallow waters of the Red Sea, devoid of life and strewn with plastic. Pugh believes that nature can recover if it is given space to do so, but the clock is ticking. If we don't start looking after our seas, we may soon have an unsolvable problem on our hands.",B1,"
Lewis wants more areas in the ocean to be protected – he wants to increase this from 3% to 10% of the world’s seas. He hopes this will help to repair the damage that people are causing, such as catching too many fish, pollution, and dropping litter. Lewis has seen this damage himself during his travels. He has swum over coral reefs that have lost their colour because the water is getting warmer, and he has seen parts of the Red Sea with no life in them, just plastic. Lewis thinks nature can get better if we let it, but we don’t have much time left. If we don’t start protecting our seas, we will soon have a very serious problem that we can’t fix.

**Here's a little explanation of some words:**

* **Coral reefs:** These are like underwater cities built by tiny animals. They are very colourful and full of life.
* **Bleached:** When coral reefs lose their colour, it means they are not healthy. This often happens when the water gets too warm.
* **Pollution:** This means making the environment dirty, for example, by adding harmful chemicals or waste.

Are things getting worse, or are they actually improving? In his book, Enlightenment Now, Steven Pinker looks at how humans have progressed over time and says there is reason to be positive. People are living longer, healthier, more free and happier lives now than in the past. 

Pinker believes the main problem is that the ideas of the Enlightenment – using reason and science to understand the world – are being questioned. When leaders and public speakers encourage people to focus on their group identity, feel hopeless, and not trust others, it could seriously harm important things like democracy and international teamwork.

In the 1950s, banana farmers in Central America had a problem. Their most popular banana, called ‘Big Mike’ (or Gros Michel), was dying. Now, the same thing is happening to the banana that replaced ‘Big Mike’ – the Cavendish banana. 

‘Big Mike’ was a great banana because it was easy to transport, had a thick skin, and tasted sweet. It grew well on farms in Central America. A company called United Fruit, which grew and sold most of the bananas at that time, found a quick way to grow them. Instead of using seeds, they took small parts of the banana plants and grew new plants from them. They planted these plants very close together in fields to grow as many bananas as possible.

Most spiders have venom, but they use it to catch animals for food, not to hurt people. Actually, only 25 types of spiders have venom that can be dangerous to humans. Spider bites can be painful, but they are usually not fatal – meaning they don’t usually cause death.

In Australia, the Sydney funnel-web spider is famous for being dangerous, but no one has died from its bite since 1981, when doctors created an anti-venom (a medicine to stop the venom’s effect). 

However, be careful with hairy spiders like tarantulas. If you bother them, they will defend themselves by shooting out tiny hairs that can irritate your skin or eyes. These hairs can get stuck in your skin and cause discomfort.

Furthermore, there is an unfortunate perception that scientists are geeky, have poor social skills or that their work is lonely and detached from the rest of the world.
