Behind the catchy rock melodies that drive these powerhouse classics are stories of the dark side of the American dream. Many tracks deal with the struggles of hard-working ordinary people and the bitterness and anger they feel as life doesn't bring them riches or glory. The song Glory Days, for example, is about people in a small town looking back at when they were young and had the world at their feet while Downbound Train tells the story of a young man whose life is ruined when he loses his job. It's not hard to imagine that the artist is channelling real people he knew and the life he might have had if he hadn't become a star. The album will leave you in no doubt of the unique and extraordinary talent of the Boss.",B1,"A fast‑moving, lively rock album, *Born in the USA* still has deep feelings in its words. Behind the catchy (easy‑to‑remember) rock tunes are stories about the sad side of the American dream. Many songs talk about the hard work of ordinary people and the bitterness and anger they feel when life does not give them money or fame. For example, the song **Glory Days** is about people in a small town remembering when they were young and felt they could do anything.

During his expeditions, Lewis has witnessed this environmental destruction first-hand. He's swum over coral reefs bleached by the increase in water temperature, and observed underwater deserts beneath the shallow waters of the Red Sea, devoid of life and strewn with plastic. Pugh believes that nature can recover if it is given space to do so, but the clock is ticking.

During his trips, Lewis has seen this damage himself. He has swum over coral reefs that have turned white because the water is getting hotter, and he has seen empty, desert‑like areas in the shallow waters of the Red Sea, with no life and lots of plastic.

We are living longer, healthier, freer and happier lives. The real problem, Pinker argues, is that the Enlightenment values of reason and science are under attack. When commentators and demagogues appeal to people's tribalism, fatalism and distrust, then we are in danger of causing irreparable damage to important institutions like democracy and world co-operation.  ",B1," things getting worse every day? Is progress impossible?  

In the book *Enlightenment Now*, Steven Pinker looks at the whole picture of human progress and finds good news. We now live longer, are healthier, have more freedom, and are happier.  

Pinker says the real problem is that the Enlightenment ideas—using reason (thinking logically) and science—are being attacked.  

When commentators and demagogues (people who try to win support by stirring strong emotions) appeal to people’s tribalism (strong loyalty to a group), fatalism (the belief that nothing can change), and distrust, we risk causing serious damage that cannot be fixed (irreparable) to important institutions such as democracy and world cooperation.",openai/gpt-oss-120b,gpt-oss-120b_descriptive_w_example,B1_PROMPT_DESCRIPTIVE_EXAMPLE,B1
