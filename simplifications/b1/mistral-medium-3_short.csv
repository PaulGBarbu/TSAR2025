I don't think this is such an issue for my generation who've lived without technology for so long. We know how to be alone and, more importantly, we know that it's OK to be alone. But the under 20s are another kettle of fish. They're so busy communicating that they never experience the feeling of solitude and run the risk of not learning how to enjoy their own company. In addition, they're learning conversation through messages that can be edited and changed at the expense of learning the art of real conversation in real time with the person in front of you.",B1,"I agree with a lot of what the speaker said.

When positive and negative feedback always appear to go hand in hand, the positives can become devalued and ignored. Ensure there are times when positive feedback is given for its own sake and resist the temptation to offer constructive criticism.",B1,"Do not always give negative feedback after positive feedback. If positive and negative feedback are always given together, the positive comments may lose their value. Sometimes, give positive feedback alone and avoid adding criticism.",mistralai/mistral-medium-3,mistral-medium-3_short,"B1_PROMPT_SHORT,",B1
