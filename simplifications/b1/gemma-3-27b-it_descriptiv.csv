The wild dogs in Moscow are a fascinating example of animals living in a city. There are about 35,000 wild dogs living in the streets of Moscow. Some were born in the wild, but others used to be pets that people left behind. 

These dogs live in different ways – some are alone, and others live in groups called packs. In 2010, scientists studied these dogs and discovered they have adapted very well to city life. They’ve learned how to survive in an urban environment. For example, they’ve found it’s safer to cross the road with people, and some even seem to know what traffic lights mean.

Lucid dreams are dreams where you're not only aware you're dreaming but you can make decisions to affect the events of your dreams. So, maybe you can turn a nightmare into a safe-feeling dream, or you can direct the plot of your dream like a film director. Then, instead of just working out the meaning of your dreams, you'll be creating them, though you might want to continue having some dreams that allow your subconscious to tell you what's on your mind! ",B1,"Some people believe that writing down your dreams can help you have more control over them. This control is called “lucid dreaming”. It means you know you are dreaming while it’s happening, and you can even change things in your dream. 

For example, if you’re having a bad dream, you might be able to make it better. Or, you could decide what happens next in your dream, just like a director controls a movie. 

Instead of only trying to understand what your dreams mean, you can start to create them yourself! But it’s still good to have some normal dreams too – they can show you what you’re thinking and feeling without you even realising it.

However, charity shops receive so many clothes that they can’t sell them all. ‘Fast fashion’ – clothes that are made quickly and cheaply to follow the latest trends – quickly becomes unwanted.

A business model that has rapidly risen in popularity sees companies providing an online platform that puts customers in contact with those who can provide a particular product or service. Companies like Airbnb act as a middleman for people to cash in on their unused rooms and houses and let them out as lucrative accommodation. Another example is Uber, which encourages people to use their own personal cars as taxis to make some extra cash in their free time.",B1,"
Companies are realising they can make a lot of money from the “sharing economy”. This means finding ways to profit from things that people aren’t using fully. 

A popular business idea is for companies to create websites or apps that connect customers with people who offer a service or product. These companies don’t directly provide the service themselves – they simply connect the people who need it with the people who can offer it.

For example, Airbnb is a company that helps people rent out spare rooms or houses. This allows people to earn money from property they aren’t using all the time. Uber is another example. It allows people to use their own cars to give rides to others and earn money. They work like taxis, but use regular people’s cars instead of professional taxi drivers.

In the wild, some of the rarest species have difficulty in finding mates and breeding, and they might also be threatened by poachers, loss of their habitat and predators. A good zoo will enable these species to live and breed in a secure environment. In addition, as numbers of some wild species drop, there is an increased danger of populations becoming too genetically similar. Breeding programmes provide a safeguard: zoo-bred animals can be released into the wild to increase genetic diversity.",B1,"Today, zoos have a very important job: helping to save endangered animals by breeding them. Some of the rarest animals struggle to find partners and have babies in the wild. They also face dangers like illegal hunting (poaching), losing their homes, and attacks from other animals.

Zoos offer a safe place for these animals to live and breed. Also, when there are very few of a certain animal left, they can become too similar genetically. This isn’t healthy for the species. 

Breeding programmes in zoos help with this problem. Animals born in zoos can be released back into the wild, which helps to create more genetic diversity – meaning a wider variety of genes within the population. This makes the species stronger and more likely to survive.

However, when feedback becomes such a routine, employees can start to perceive positive feedback as simply a form of sugarcoating the negatives, thus diminishing its value. Instead, positive feedback should not simply be seen as something to cushion the negative, but should be delivered so as to reinforce and encourage good performance.",B1,"Many managers try to make feedback more positive by starting and ending with good comments, and putting the criticism in the middle – this is often called the “sandwich method”. However, if feedback is given this way too often, employees might think the positive comments aren’t sincere, and are just used to make the criticism seem softer. This can make the good comments less meaningful. Instead of using positive feedback to soften bad news, managers should give praise to encourage and support good work when it happens. This shows employees what they are doing well and helps them to continue performing at a high level.

I work with a group called the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots. You might imagine robots as scary machines from films, but this is happening now. Today, the army uses machines like drones – aircraft without a pilot – and robot guns to attack people, and humans don’t have much control. 

The next development will be robots that can choose who to kill by themselves. These robots will follow instructions, but they will make the final decision. I believe this is very wrong and could be a big risk to people. We need to be careful about giving machines too much power and deciding what jobs they can do.

For example, “Glory Days” is about people in a small town remembering their youth and lost opportunities. “Downbound Train” tells the story of a young man whose life is destroyed after he loses his job.

Or, their phone battery will run out while they are trying to call. Sometimes, both things happen! This makes the situation more frightening for both the character and the audience.

With its easily transported, thick-skinned and sweet-tasting fruit, the Gros Michel banana plant dominated the plantations of Central America.

A company called United Fruit was the biggest banana grower and seller at that time. They found a quick and efficient way to grow lots of bananas. Instead of planting seeds, they copied parts of existing plants – this is called cloning. They also grew the plants very close together in fields.

Coupled with this is the lack of positive female role models youngsters see doing science-related jobs.

Furthermore, there is an unfortunate perception that scientists are geeky, have poor social skills or that their work is lonely and detached from the rest of the world. These are false stereotypes portrayed by the media, but they may mean that girls do not identify with scientists, and see science as an unappealing career path.

It’s not natural for girls to prefer subjects like art and literature – society teaches them to. We are often told that boys are better at subjects like maths and physics. Also, young people don’t often see women working in science jobs. 

Often, in cartoons and stories, scientists, inventors, and astronauts are shown as men. There’s also a wrong idea that scientists are strange, not very social, or work alone. These ideas come from TV, films and other media. 

Because of these ideas, girls might not think science is a job for them, and they might not want to study it.
