tsar2025testblind,113-b1,"Spider venom is present in most species and serves the purpose of stunning or killing their prey rather than attacking humans. In fact, only 25 of the known spider species produce venom which can actually harm humans, and although spider bites can be painful, they are rarely deadly. Australia's notorious Sydney funnel-web spider has not produced any fatalities since anti-venom was developed in 1981. However, take care not to rub hairy spiders like tarantulas up the wrong way. When they feel in danger, they defend themselves by ejecting a cloud of urticating hairs. These irritating hairs then embed themselves in the skin or eyes of the attacker.",B1,"Most spiders have venom, but it's not to hurt humans. It's to catch their prey. Only a few spider species can harm people with their venom. Although spider bites can be painful, they are rarely fatal. In Australia, there's a spider called the Sydney funnel-web spider. It's very poisonous, but nobody has died from its bite since doctors found an antidote in 1981. However, be careful with hairy spiders like tarantulas.

It starts with a group of teenagers all enjoying themselves, and it ends with everyone dead except one girl. At the beginning the girl is usually innocent, shy and not particularly strong. By the end, she has become the toughest and most resourceful person in the world. The last girl almost always wins in the end.",B1,"This is a common idea in horror movies from the late 20th century.

tsar2025testblind,115-b1,"If we want to know where our capability for complex language came from, we need to look at how our brains are different from other animals. This relates to more than just brain size; it is important what other things our brains can do and when and why they evolved that way. And for this there are very few physical clues; artefacts left by our ancestors don't tell us what speech they were capable of making. One thing we can see in the remains of early humans, however, is the development of the mouth, throat and tongue. By about 100,000 years ago, humans had evolved the ability to create complex sounds. Before that, evolutionary biologists can only guess whether or not early humans communicated using more basic sounds.",B1,"To understand where our ability to use complex language comes from, we need to look at what makes our brains different from those of other animals. It's not just about the size of our brains, but also what they can do and how they developed over time. Unfortunately, we don't have many physical clues to help us, as the things our ancestors left behind don't tell us what kind of sounds they could make. However, we can see from the remains of early humans that their mouths, throats, and tongues developed in a way that allowed them to make complex sounds around 100,000 years ago. Before that, we can only speculate about whether early humans used simpler sounds to communicate.",meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct,llama-3.3-70b-instruct_short,B1_PROMPT_SHORT,B1
tsar2025testblind,116-b1,"It is society, not nature, that tells us girls should favour arts and humanities and leave maths and physics to the boys. Coupled with this is the lack of positive female role models youngsters see doing science-related jobs. Cartoons and stories often show the crazy scientist, genius inventor, or adventurous astronaut as a man. Furthermore, there is an unfortunate perception that scientists are geeky, have poor social skills or that their work is lonely and detached from the rest of the world. These are false stereotypes portrayed by the media, but they may mean that girls do not identify with scientists, and see science as an unappealing career path. If girls saw more positive female role models in science it would give them more confidence and a greater sense of belonging in those subjects.",B1,"It's not nature, but society that says girls should like arts and humanities, and boys should like maths and physics. There are not many women in science jobs that young people can look up to. Often, scientists in cartoons and stories are men. Many people also think that scientists are strange, shy, and work alone. This is not true, but it might stop girls from wanting to be scientists.

I don't think this is such an issue for my generation who've lived without technology for so long. We know how to be alone and, more importantly, we know that it's OK to be alone. But the under 20s are another kettle of fish. They're so busy communicating that they never experience the feeling of solitude and run the risk of not learning how to enjoy their own company.
