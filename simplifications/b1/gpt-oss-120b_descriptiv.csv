He's swum over coral reefs bleached by the increase in water temperature, and observed underwater deserts beneath the shallow waters of the Red Sea, devoid of life and strewn with plastic.

We are living longer, healthier, freer and happier lives. The real problem, Pinker argues, is that the Enlightenment values of reason and science are under attack. When commentators and demagogues appeal to people's tribalism, fatalism and distrust, then we are in danger of causing irreparable damage to important institutions like democracy and world co-operation.

In the book *Enlightenment Now*, Steven Pinker looks at the whole picture of human progress and finds good news. We now live longer, are healthier, have more freedom and are happier.  

Pinker says the real problem is that the ideas of the Enlightenment – mainly using reason (thinking logically) and science – are being attacked.  

When commentators and demagogues (people who try to gain power by using strong emotions and lies) appeal to people’s tribalism (strong loyalty to their own group), fatalism (the belief that nothing can change) and distrust, we risk causing serious, lasting damage to important institutions such as democracy and world cooperation.",openai/gpt-oss-120b,gpt-oss-120b_descriptiv,B1_PROMPT_DESCRIPTIVE,B1

This relates to more than just brain size; it is important what other things our brains can do and when and why they evolved that way. And for this there are very few physical clues; artefacts left by our ancestors don't tell us what speech they were capable of making. One thing we can see in the remains of early humans, however, is the development of the mouth, throat and tongue. By about 100,000 years ago, humans had evolved the ability to create complex sounds.

Furthermore, there is an unfortunate perception that scientists are geeky, have poor social skills or that their work is lonely and detached from the rest of the world.
