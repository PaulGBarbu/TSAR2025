Only 25 types of spiders can harm humans, and their bites are rarely deadly. The Sydney funnel-web spider in Australia hasn't caused any deaths since they made an antidote in 1981. However, be careful with hairy spiders like tarantulas. When they feel threatened, they release a cloud of irritating hairs that can stick to your skin or eyes.",deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b,deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b_short,A2_PROMPT_SHORT,A2
tsar2025testblind,114-a2,"This horror film cliché was especially popular with horror films of the late 20th century. It starts with a group of teenagers all enjoying themselves, and it ends with everyone dead except one girl. At the beginning the girl is usually innocent, shy and not particularly strong. By the end, she has become the toughest and most resourceful person in the world. The last girl almost always wins in the end.",A2,"This is a common story in horror movies, especially from the late 1900s. A group of teenagers have fun together, but by the end, only one girl survives. At first, she is shy and weak, but she becomes strong and clever.

tsar2025testblind,115-a2,"If we want to know where our capability for complex language came from, we need to look at how our brains are different from other animals. This relates to more than just brain size; it is important what other things our brains can do and when and why they evolved that way. And for this there are very few physical clues; artefacts left by our ancestors don't tell us what speech they were capable of making. One thing we can see in the remains of early humans, however, is the development of the mouth, throat and tongue. By about 100,000 years ago, humans had evolved the ability to create complex sounds. Before that, evolutionary biologists can only guess whether or not early humans communicated using more basic sounds.",A2,"If we want to understand where our ability to use complex language comes from, we need to look at what makes the human brain different from other animals. This is not just about the size of the brain but also about what other things our brains can do and how and why they developed in that way. However, there are very few physical clues to help us answer these questions. The things left behind by our ancestors do not tell us what kind of sounds they could make. One thing we can see from the remains of early humans is how their mouths, throats, and tongues developed. By about 100,000 years ago, humans had developed the ability to make complex sounds.

tsar2025testblind,116-a2,"It is society, not nature, that tells us girls should favour arts and humanities and leave maths and physics to the boys. Coupled with this is the lack of positive female role models youngsters see doing science-related jobs. Cartoons and stories often show the crazy scientist, genius inventor, or adventurous astronaut as a man. Furthermore, there is an unfortunate perception that scientists are geeky, have poor social skills or that their work is lonely and detached from the rest of the world. These are false stereotypes portrayed by the media, but they may mean that girls do not identify with scientists, and see science as an unappealing career path. If girls saw more positive female role models in science it would give them more confidence and a greater sense of belonging in those subjects.",A2,"It’s society, not nature, that tells girls to like arts and humanities and leave math and physics to boys. There are not enough positive female role models in science jobs. In cartoons and stories, scientists, inventors, and astronauts are often men. People often think scientists are nerdy, have poor social skills, or work alone. These are false ideas from the media. So girls might not see themselves as scientists and think science isn’t for them.

tsar2025testblind,119-a2,"So much of what the speaker said rang true. I honestly believe there's a danger that the more connected we are, the more isolated we feel. I don't think this is such an issue for my generation who've lived without technology for so long. We know how to be alone and, more importantly, we know that it's OK to be alone. But the under 20s are another kettle of fish. They're so busy communicating that they never experience the feeling of solitude and run the risk of not learning how to enjoy their own company. In addition, they're learning conversation through messages that can be edited and changed at the expense of learning the art of real conversation in real time with the person in front of you.",A2,"The speaker made some good points. I think that even though we are more connected, we might feel more alone. This is not a big problem for my generation because we grew up without much technology. We know how to be alone, and it's okay. But young people are different. They are always communicating, so they don’t know what it’s like to be alone. They might not learn to enjoy being by themselves. They learn to talk by sending messages they can edit.
