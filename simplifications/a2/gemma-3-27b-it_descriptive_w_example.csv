Your dreams can tell you things about yourself, things you didn’t know you were thinking about. Many people have similar dreams, like flying or falling.

But to understand what your dreams mean for *you*, you need to think about what is happening in your life and how you feel each day.

Many people don’t know they are part of the problem with clothes being thrown away, even when they give their old clothes to charity. But charity shops can’t sell all the clothes people give them. ‘Fast fashion’ means clothes are quickly made, become unpopular quickly, and are often not good quality enough to make into something new. People don’t want to buy these clothes even when they are second-hand. So, a lot of clothes are thrown away. Also, charities send some clothes they can’t sell to other countries, which causes problems for those countries’ economies and the environment.

A business model that has rapidly risen in popularity sees companies providing an online platform that puts customers in contact with those who can provide a particular product or service.

Another example is Uber, which encourages people to use their own personal cars as taxis to make some extra cash in their free time.",A2,"
Companies have noticed that the “sharing economy” can make them money, so they are trying to use it to their advantage. The sharing economy means making money from things people aren’t using all the time.

A popular way to do this is for companies to create websites or apps that connect customers with people who can offer a service or product. For example, Airbnb is a company that helps people rent out spare rooms or houses to travellers. They act as a go-between, connecting people who have space with people who need a place to stay. 

Uber is another example. It lets people use their own cars to give rides to others and earn money when they have free time.

tsar2025testblind,85-a2,"One of the most important modern functions of zoos is supporting international breeding programmes, particularly for endangered species. In the wild, some of the rarest species have difficulty in finding mates and breeding, and they might also be threatened by poachers, loss of their habitat and predators. A good zoo will enable these species to live and breed in a secure environment. In addition, as numbers of some wild species drop, there is an increased danger of populations becoming too genetically similar. Breeding programmes provide a safeguard: zoo-bred animals can be released into the wild to increase genetic diversity.",A2,"
Today, zoos are very important for helping to save animals. They especially help with breeding programmes for animals that are in danger of disappearing. In nature, it can be hard for these rare animals to find partners and have babies. Also, people who hunt illegally (called poachers), losing their homes, and other animals that hunt them can all cause problems. A good zoo keeps these animals safe so they can live and have babies.

Also, when there are fewer and fewer of a type of animal, they can become too similar genetically. This isn’t good for them. Breeding programmes help with this. Animals born in zoos can be released back into nature to make the animal population healthier and more diverse. This means there’s more variety in their genes.

With trains, it's the velocity of the impact that can bring a bridge down. With boats, it's the very large mass they have that can bring about the collapse, even if they are moving very slowly when it occurs. The best way to avoid bridge failures is to plan for them. Modern technologies that can detect structural weakness, safer working environments and better designs can all help to reduce these terrible accidents.",A2,"
These accidents almost never happen, but boats and trains can both cause a bridge to fall down, but in different ways. For trains, it’s how fast they are going when they hit the bridge that can make it fall. For boats, it’s how heavy they are – even if they are going slowly, they can still cause a collapse.

The best way to stop bridges from falling is to be prepared. New technology can find problems with the bridge before they become serious. Also, making sure workers are safe and designing bridges well can help to avoid these bad accidents.

tsar2025testblind,107-a2,"A fast-paced, foot-tapping rock album, Born in the USA's lyrics nevertheless carry emotional weight. Behind the catchy rock melodies that drive these powerhouse classics are stories of the dark side of the American dream. Many tracks deal with the struggles of hard-working ordinary people and the bitterness and anger they feel as life doesn't bring them riches or glory. The song Glory Days, for example, is about people in a small town looking back at when they were young and had the world at their feet while Downbound Train tells the story of a young man whose life is ruined when he loses his job. It's not hard to imagine that the artist is channelling real people he knew and the life he might have had if he hadn't become a star. The album will leave you in no doubt of the unique and extraordinary talent of the Boss.",A2,"
Born in the USA is a rock album with fast, exciting songs that make you want to tap your feet. But the songs also have a lot of feeling. Even though the songs sound happy, they tell stories about difficult times. They are about the problems of normal people who work hard, but don’t get rich or famous. 

For example, the song “Glory Days” is about people remembering when they were young and full of hope. The song “Downbound Train” is about a young man whose life gets worse when he loses his job. 

You can feel that the singer is thinking about people he knew and how his life could have been different. This album shows how special and talented the singer – known as ‘The Boss’ – really is.

He's swum over coral reefs bleached by the increase in water temperature, and observed underwater deserts beneath the shallow waters of the Red Sea, devoid of life and strewn with plastic. Pugh believes that nature can recover if it is given space to do so, but the clock is ticking. If we don't start looking after our seas, we may soon have an unsolvable problem on our hands.",A2,"
Lewis wants more areas in the sea to be protected. Now, only 3 out of every 100 parts of the sea are protected. He wants to increase this to 10 out of 100. He hopes this will help fix the harm people are doing to the sea, like catching too many fish, making the water dirty, and dropping rubbish.

Lewis has seen the damage himself when he has been travelling. He has seen coral reefs become white and die because the water is getting warmer. He has also seen parts of the Red Sea with no fish or plants, just plastic. 

Lewis thinks nature can get better if we let it. But he says we don’t have much time. If we don’t start protecting our seas, there will be a very big problem that we can’t fix.

In his book, Enlightenment Now, Steven Pinker looks at how life has changed for people around the world and finds some good things. We are living longer, we are healthier, we have more freedom and we are happier. Pinker thinks the real problem is that people are not trusting in reason (thinking carefully) and science (studying the world around us) as much as they should.

With its easily transported, thick-skinned and sweet-tasting fruit, the Gros Michel banana plant dominated the plantations of Central America.

Now, the same thing is happening to the banana that came after ‘Big Mike’ – the Cavendish banana. ‘Big Mike’ was a good banana because it was easy to carry, had a thick skin, and tasted sweet. It grew on many farms in Central America.

United Fruit was the main company that grew and sold bananas at that time. They found a fast way to grow lots of bananas. Instead of using seeds, they took small parts from banana plants and grew new plants from them. They planted these plants very close together in big fields.

Most spiders have venom, which they use to stop or kill the animals they eat. They don’t usually attack people with it. Actually, only 25 kinds of spiders have venom that can really hurt people. Spider bites can be painful, but they very rarely cause death.

In Australia, the Sydney funnel-web spider is famous for being dangerous, but nobody has died from its bite since they made an anti-venom in 1981. Anti-venom is a medicine that stops the venom from hurting you.

Be careful not to stroke hairy spiders like tarantulas the wrong way. If they feel scared, they will defend themselves by shooting out tiny hairs that can irritate your skin or eyes. These hairs get stuck in your skin or eyes and can cause discomfort.

Coupled with this is the lack of positive female role models youngsters see doing science-related jobs. Cartoons and stories often show the crazy scientist, genius inventor, or adventurous astronaut as a man. Furthermore, there is an unfortunate perception that scientists are geeky, have poor social skills or that their work is lonely and detached from the rest of the world. These are false stereotypes portrayed by the media, but they may mean that girls do not identify with scientists, and see science as an unappealing career path. If girls saw more positive female role models in science it would give them more confidence and a greater sense of belonging in those subjects.",A2,"
People, not nature, teach girls that they are better at subjects like art and literature, and boys are better at maths and science. Also, young people don't often see women working in science jobs. In cartoons and stories, scientists, inventors, and astronauts are usually men.

Also, some people think scientists are strange, not very social, or work alone. This is not true, but it’s what the media often shows. Because of this, girls might not think science is a good job for them, and they might not feel they fit in.
