Lucid dreams are dreams where you're not only aware you're dreaming but you can make decisions to affect the events of your dreams. So, maybe you can turn a nightmare into a safe-feeling dream, or you can direct the plot of your dream like a film director. Then, instead of just working out the meaning of your dreams, you'll be creating them, though you might want to continue having some dreams that allow your subconscious to tell you what's on your mind! ",A2,"Some people think writing your dreams down can help you have lucid dreams. Lucid dreams are dreams where you know you are dreaming and you can control what happens in your dreams. So, maybe you can change a scary dream into a nice dream, or you can control your dream like making a movie.

In the wild, some of the rarest species have difficulty in finding mates and breeding, and they might also be threatened by poachers, loss of their habitat and predators.

In nature, some very rare animals cannot find other animals to have babies with. These animals also have problems because people hunt them, they lose their homes, and other animals eat them. A good zoo gives these animals a safe place to live and have babies. Also, when there are not many wild animals left, they can become too similar to each other. This is not good for the animals.

tsar2025testblind,107-a2,"A fast-paced, foot-tapping rock album, Born in the USA's lyrics nevertheless carry emotional weight. Behind the catchy rock melodies that drive these powerhouse classics are stories of the dark side of the American dream. Many tracks deal with the struggles of hard-working ordinary people and the bitterness and anger they feel as life doesn't bring them riches or glory. The song Glory Days, for example, is about people in a small town looking back at when they were young and had the world at their feet while Downbound Train tells the story of a young man whose life is ruined when he loses his job. It's not hard to imagine that the artist is channelling real people he knew and the life he might have had if he hadn't become a star. The album will leave you in no doubt of the unique and extraordinary talent of the Boss.",A2,"Born in the USA is a rock music album that is fast and makes you want to move your feet. But the words in the songs talk about sad and difficult things. The songs have good music that people like, but they tell stories about the bad parts of life in America. Many songs are about normal working people who have problems. These people feel angry and sad because their life is hard and they don't get rich or famous. For example, the song Glory Days is about people in a small town who remember when they were young and everything seemed possible. Another song, Downbound Train, tells the story of a young man whose life becomes terrible when he loses his job. You can think that the singer is talking about real people he knew and the life he could have had if he didn't become famous. When you listen to this album, you will understand that the Boss (this is what people call the singer) has very special talent.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4,claude-sonnet-4_descriptive_w_example,A2_PROMPT_DESCRIPTIVE_EXAMPLE,A2

He's swum over coral reefs bleached by the increase in water temperature, and observed underwater deserts beneath the shallow waters of the Red Sea, devoid of life and strewn with plastic.

With its easily transported, thick-skinned and sweet-tasting fruit, the Gros Michel banana plant dominated the plantations of Central America. United Fruit, the main grower and exporter in South America at the time, mass-produced its bananas in the most efficient way possible: it cloned shoots from the stems of plants instead of growing plants from seeds, and cultivated them in densely packed fields.",A2,"In the 1950s, people who grew bananas in Central America had a big problem. Their best banana, called Gros Michel or Big Mike, was dying. Now the same thing is happening again to the banana that replaced Big Mike - the Cavendish banana.

United Fruit was the biggest company that grew and sold bananas in South America at that time. They wanted to make as many bananas as possible in the easiest way. So they did not grow new plants from seeds. Instead, they took small parts from banana plant stems and made copies of the same plant.

In fact, only 25 of the known spider species produce venom which can actually harm humans, and although spider bites can be painful, they are rarely deadly. Australia's notorious Sydney funnel-web spider has not produced any fatalities since anti-venom was developed in 1981. However, take care not to rub hairy spiders like tarantulas up the wrong way.

One thing we can see in the remains of early humans, however, is the development of the mouth, throat and tongue. By about 100,000 years ago, humans had evolved the ability to create complex sounds.

Coupled with this is the lack of positive female role models youngsters see doing science-related jobs.

Furthermore, there is an unfortunate perception that scientists are geeky, have poor social skills or that their work is lonely and detached from the rest of the world. These are false stereotypes portrayed by the media, but they may mean that girls do not identify with scientists, and see science as an unappealing career path.
