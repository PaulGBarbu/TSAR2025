tsar2025testblind,116-a2,"It is society, not nature, that tells us girls should favour arts and humanities and leave maths and physics to the boys. Coupled with this is the lack of positive female role models youngsters see doing science-related jobs. Cartoons and stories often show the crazy scientist, genius inventor, or adventurous astronaut as a man. Furthermore, there is an unfortunate perception that scientists are geeky, have poor social skills or that their work is lonely and detached from the rest of the world. These are false stereotypes portrayed by the media, but they may mean that girls do not identify with scientists, and see science as an unappealing career path. If girls saw more positive female role models in science it would give them more confidence and a greater sense of belonging in those subjects.",A2,"Society, not nature, tells us that girls should like arts and humanities and leave maths and physics to boys.

tsar2025testblind,117-a2,"The Scallion is printed weekly and distributed free in faculty buildings, with a readership of approximately 10,000 students. It is written and produced entirely by students. The survey shows that the newspaper is highly valued by university students and staff for entertainment, cultural enrichment and work experience. The cost of printing newspapers is significant. Furthermore, some students do not have easy access to the paper, since the only way to obtain a copy is to physically go to university. An additional environmental issue is that a large number of copies end up as litter on campus.",A2,"The Scallion is a free newspaper that comes out every week in faculty buildings.

tsar2025testblind,119-a2,"So much of what the speaker said rang true. I honestly believe there's a danger that the more connected we are, the more isolated we feel. I don't think this is such an issue for my generation who've lived without technology for so long. We know how to be alone and, more importantly, we know that it's OK to be alone. But the under 20s are another kettle of fish. They're so busy communicating that they never experience the feeling of solitude and run the risk of not learning how to enjoy their own company. In addition, they're learning conversation through messages that can be edited and changed at the expense of learning the art of real conversation in real time with the person in front of you.",A2,"What the speaker said feels very true. I think that when we are more connected, we can feel more alone. This is not a big problem for my generation. We grew up without much technology. We know how to be alone and we know that being alone is OK. 

But for people under 20, it is different. They are always talking online. They never feel alone and may not learn how to enjoy their own company. They also learn to talk by sending messages that can be edited. This can stop them from learning real conversation with the person right in front of them.",openai/gpt-oss-120b,gpt-oss-120b_short,A2_PROMPT_SHORT,A2

Ensure there are times when positive feedback is given for its own sake and resist the temptation to offer constructive criticism.",A2,"Don't always put negative feedback after positive feedback.
