Many songs are about ordinary people who work hard but feel angry and sad because life didn’t give them money or success. For example, ""Glory Days"" is about people in a small town remembering when they were young and full of hope. ""Downbound Train"" is about a young man whose life falls apart when he loses his job. It feels like the artist is talking about real people he knows or a life he might have had if he wasn’t famous. This album clearly shows how talented the artist is.",deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b,deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b_descriptive_w_example,A2_PROMPT_DESCRIPTIVE_EXAMPLE,A2

He's swum over coral reefs bleached by the increase in water temperature, and observed underwater deserts beneath the shallow waters of the Red Sea, devoid of life and strewn with plastic.
