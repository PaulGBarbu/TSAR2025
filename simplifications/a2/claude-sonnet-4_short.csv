About 100,000 years ago, humans could make complex sounds. Before that time, scientists can only guess if early humans talked using simple sounds.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4,claude-sonnet-4_short,A2_PROMPT_SHORT,A2
tsar2025testblind,116-a2,"It is society, not nature, that tells us girls should favour arts and humanities and leave maths and physics to the boys. Coupled with this is the lack of positive female role models youngsters see doing science-related jobs. Cartoons and stories often show the crazy scientist, genius inventor, or adventurous astronaut as a man. Furthermore, there is an unfortunate perception that scientists are geeky, have poor social skills or that their work is lonely and detached from the rest of the world. These are false stereotypes portrayed by the media, but they may mean that girls do not identify with scientists, and see science as an unappealing career path. If girls saw more positive female role models in science it would give them more confidence and a greater sense of belonging in those subjects.",A2,"Society tells us that girls should like arts and languages, and boys should do maths and science. Also, young people don't see many women working in science jobs. In cartoons and stories, scientists and inventors are usually men. Many people think scientists are strange, not good with people, or work alone. These ideas are not true, but they come from TV and movies. Because of this, girls don't want to be scientists. If girls saw more women scientists, they would feel more confident about studying science.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4,claude-sonnet-4_short,A2_PROMPT_SHORT,A2
tsar2025testblind,117-a2,"The Scallion is printed weekly and distributed free in faculty buildings, with a readership of approximately 10,000 students. It is written and produced entirely by students. The survey shows that the newspaper is highly valued by university students and staff for entertainment, cultural enrichment and work experience. The cost of printing newspapers is significant. Furthermore, some students do not have easy access to the paper, since the only way to obtain a copy is to physically go to university. An additional environmental issue is that a large number of copies end up as litter on campus.",A2,"The Scallion comes out every week and is free in university buildings. About 10,000 students read it. Students write and make the newspaper. A study shows that university students and workers like the newspaper because it is fun, teaches about culture, and gives work experience. Printing newspapers costs a lot of money. Also, some students cannot get the newspaper easily because they must go to the university to get it. Another problem is that many newspapers become trash on campus, which is bad for the environment.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4,claude-sonnet-4_short,A2_PROMPT_SHORT,A2
tsar2025testblind,118-a2,"At Girox Foods, we are experiencing an annual employee turnover of about 12 per cent. Although this might not seem high at first glance, the industry standard is seven per cent. The principal objective of this report is to investigate the causes of employee engagement within the firm and, based on those, offer recommendations to improve the employees' experience of the workplace and increase employee retention.",A2,"At Girox Foods, 12% of our workers leave every year. This number seems okay, but other companies in our business only lose 7% of workers each year. This report will look at why workers are not happy at our company. We will then give ideas to make the workplace better and help more workers stay with us.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4,claude-sonnet-4_short,A2_PROMPT_SHORT,A2
tsar2025testblind,119-a2,"So much of what the speaker said rang true. I honestly believe there's a danger that the more connected we are, the more isolated we feel. I don't think this is such an issue for my generation who've lived without technology for so long. We know how to be alone and, more importantly, we know that it's OK to be alone. But the under 20s are another kettle of fish. They're so busy communicating that they never experience the feeling of solitude and run the risk of not learning how to enjoy their own company. In addition, they're learning conversation through messages that can be edited and changed at the expense of learning the art of real conversation in real time with the person in front of you.",A2,"I agree with what the speaker said. I think when we use technology more, we can feel more alone. This isn't a big problem for older people like me. We lived without technology for a long time. We know how to be alone and we know it's OK to be alone. But young people under 20 are different. They always communicate with others, so they never learn to be alone. They don't learn to enjoy being by themselves. Also, they learn to talk through messages that they can change and edit. But they don't learn how to have real conversations with people face to face.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4,claude-sonnet-4_short,A2_PROMPT_SHORT,A2

When positive and negative feedback always appear to go hand in hand, the positives can become devalued and ignored. Ensure there are times when positive feedback is given for its own sake and resist the temptation to offer constructive criticism.",A2,"Don't always give negative feedback after positive feedback. When you always give both together, people will not value the positive comments. Sometimes just give positive feedback on its own.
