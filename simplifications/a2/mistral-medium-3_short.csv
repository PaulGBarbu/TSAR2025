tsar2025testblind,119-a2,"So much of what the speaker said rang true. I honestly believe there's a danger that the more connected we are, the more isolated we feel. I don't think this is such an issue for my generation who've lived without technology for so long. We know how to be alone and, more importantly, we know that it's OK to be alone. But the under 20s are another kettle of fish. They're so busy communicating that they never experience the feeling of solitude and run the risk of not learning how to enjoy their own company. In addition, they're learning conversation through messages that can be edited and changed at the expense of learning the art of real conversation in real time with the person in front of you.",A2,"I agree with much of what the speaker said. I think there is a real danger that the more connected we are, the more alone we feel. This is not a big problem for my generation because we lived without technology for a long time. We know how to be alone, and we know it is okay to be alone. But young people under 20 are different. They are always communicating, so they never feel real solitude. They might not learn to enjoy being alone. Also, they learn to talk through messages that can be edited, instead of learning how to have real conversations face-to-face.",mistralai/mistral-medium-3,mistral-medium-3_short,"A2_PROMPT_SHORT,",A2

When positive and negative feedback always appear to go hand in hand, the positives can become devalued and ignored. Ensure there are times when positive feedback is given for its own sake and resist the temptation to offer constructive criticism.",A2,"Do not always give negative feedback after positive feedback. If positive and negative feedback are always together, the positive comments may lose their value. Sometimes, give positive feedback alone and avoid adding criticism.",mistralai/mistral-medium-3,mistral-medium-3_short,"A2_PROMPT_SHORT,",A2
