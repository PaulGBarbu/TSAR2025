In the wild, some of the rarest species have difficulty in finding mates and breeding, and they might also be threatened by poachers, loss of their habitat and predators. A good zoo will enable these species to live and breed in a secure environment. In addition, as numbers of some wild species drop, there is an increased danger of populations becoming too genetically similar. Breeding programmes provide a safeguard: zoo-bred animals can be released into the wild to increase genetic diversity.",A2,"One of the most important jobs of zoos today is helping animals that are in danger. Zoos work with other zoos around the world to help these animals have babies. In nature, some very rare animals have trouble finding a partner to have babies with. They also face dangers like people hunting them, losing their homes, and other animals attacking them. A good zoo gives these animals a safe place to live and have babies.

Another problem is that when there are very few animals left in the wild, they can become too similar to each other. This is not good for their health. Zoo breeding programs help by making sure there are enough different animals. Then, some of these animals can be set free in the wild to make the group stronger and healthier.",mistralai/mistral-medium-3,mistral-medium-3_descriptive_w_example,A2_PROMPT_DESCRIPTIVE_EXAMPLE,A2

We are living longer, healthier, freer and happier lives. The real problem, Pinker argues, is that the Enlightenment values of reason and science are under attack. When commentators and demagogues appeal to people's tribalism, fatalism and distrust, then we are in danger of causing irreparable damage to important institutions like democracy and world co-operation.  ",A2,"Are things getting worse every day? Is it impossible to make the world better? In his book *Enlightenment Now*, Steven Pinker looks at how humans have improved over time. He finds good news: people live longer, are healthier, have more freedom, and are happier. But Pinker says there is a big problem. The ideas of reason and science, which helped make progress, are being attacked. When leaders and speakers use fear, negative thinking, and distrust, they can hurt important things like democracy and working together around the world.",mistralai/mistral-medium-3,mistral-medium-3_descriptive_w_example,A2_PROMPT_DESCRIPTIVE_EXAMPLE,A2

Mobile phones have made that situation a bit less believable now. What's the solution to maintain suspense? No phone coverage! If you're a hero in a horror film, it's almost certain that at a key moment, just when you absolutely need to call for help, you will not have any coverage at all. Or your phone battery will die just as you are making the call. Or both.",A2,"In old scary movies, when the main characters were in big trouble, they couldn’t call for help or call the police. It was hard or even impossible. Now, because of mobile phones, this seems less real. So, how do movies keep the scary feeling? No phone signal! If you are the hero in a scary movie, you can be sure that at the worst moment, when you really need to call for help, your phone won’t work.

And now it's happening again to Big Mike's successor – the Cavendish. With its easily transported, thick-skinned and sweet-tasting fruit, the Gros Michel banana plant dominated the plantations of Central America. United Fruit, the main grower and exporter in South America at the time, mass-produced its bananas in the most efficient way possible: it cloned shoots from the stems of plants instead of growing plants from seeds, and cultivated them in densely packed fields.",A2,"In the 1950s, banana companies in Central America had a big problem. Their most popular banana, called the Gros Michel or ""Big Mike,"" was dying. Now, the same thing is happening to the Cavendish banana, which replaced the Gros Michel.

The Gros Michel banana was very popular because it was easy to transport, had thick skin, and tasted sweet. It grew on many farms in Central America. The main company that grew and sold bananas at that time was United Fruit. They made bananas in a fast way: instead of growing new plants from seeds, they took parts from old plants and grew them in big, crowded fields.",mistralai/mistral-medium-3,mistral-medium-3_descriptive_w_example,A2_PROMPT_DESCRIPTIVE_EXAMPLE,A2
tsar2025testblind,113-a2,"Spider venom is present in most species and serves the purpose of stunning or killing their prey rather than attacking humans. In fact, only 25 of the known spider species produce venom which can actually harm humans, and although spider bites can be painful, they are rarely deadly. Australia's notorious Sydney funnel-web spider has not produced any fatalities since anti-venom was developed in 1981. However, take care not to rub hairy spiders like tarantulas up the wrong way. When they feel in danger, they defend themselves by ejecting a cloud of urticating hairs. These irritating hairs then embed themselves in the skin or eyes of the attacker.",A2,"Most spiders have venom to catch their food, not to hurt people. Only 25 types of spiders can really harm humans. Even though spider bites can hurt, they are almost never deadly. For example, the dangerous Sydney funnel-web spider in Australia has not killed anyone since 1981 because there is now medicine to help. But be careful with hairy spiders like tarantulas.

tsar2025testblind,115-a2,"If we want to know where our capability for complex language came from, we need to look at how our brains are different from other animals. This relates to more than just brain size; it is important what other things our brains can do and when and why they evolved that way. And for this there are very few physical clues; artefacts left by our ancestors don't tell us what speech they were capable of making. One thing we can see in the remains of early humans, however, is the development of the mouth, throat and tongue. By about 100,000 years ago, humans had evolved the ability to create complex sounds. Before that, evolutionary biologists can only guess whether or not early humans communicated using more basic sounds.",A2,"To understand where our ability to use complex language comes from, we need to look at how our brains are different from other animals. It’s not just about the size of the brain—it’s also about what the brain can do and how it changed over time. But there are very few clues from the past. Things left by our ancestors don’t tell us what kind of speech they could make.

However, we can see changes in the bones of early humans, like in their mouths, throats, and tongues. By about 100,000 years ago, humans could make complex sounds.

tsar2025testblind,116-a2,"It is society, not nature, that tells us girls should favour arts and humanities and leave maths and physics to the boys. Coupled with this is the lack of positive female role models youngsters see doing science-related jobs. Cartoons and stories often show the crazy scientist, genius inventor, or adventurous astronaut as a man. Furthermore, there is an unfortunate perception that scientists are geeky, have poor social skills or that their work is lonely and detached from the rest of the world. These are false stereotypes portrayed by the media, but they may mean that girls do not identify with scientists, and see science as an unappealing career path. If girls saw more positive female role models in science it would give them more confidence and a greater sense of belonging in those subjects.",A2,"People often say that girls should like art and books, while boys should like math and science. This idea comes from society, not nature. Also, girls do not see many women working in science jobs. In movies and stories, scientists, inventors, and astronauts are usually men. Many people think scientists are strange, not good at talking to others, or that they work alone. These ideas are not true, but they make girls think science is not for them.

I don't think this is such an issue for my generation who've lived without technology for so long. We know how to be alone and, more importantly, we know that it's OK to be alone. But the under 20s are another kettle of fish. They're so busy communicating that they never experience the feeling of solitude and run the risk of not learning how to enjoy their own company. In addition, they're learning conversation through messages that can be edited and changed at the expense of learning the art of real conversation in real time with the person in front of you.",A2,"I really agree with what the speaker said. I think it’s true that the more we use technology to connect with others, the more alone we might feel. For people in my age group, this isn’t such a big problem because we lived for a long time without technology. We know how to be alone, and we understand that it’s fine to be alone. But young people under 20 are different. They spend so much time talking to others online that they never really feel what it’s like to be alone.
