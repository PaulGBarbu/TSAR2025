tsar2025testblind,110-a2,"Are things getting worse every day? Is progress an impossible goal? In Enlightenment Now, Steven Pinker looks at the big picture of human progress and finds good news. We are living longer, healthier, freer and happier lives. The real problem, Pinker argues, is that the Enlightenment values of reason and science are under attack. When commentators and demagogues appeal to people's tribalism, fatalism and distrust, then we are in danger of causing irreparable damage to important institutions like democracy and world co-operation.  ",A2,"Are things getting worse each day? Is making progress impossible? In the book *Enlightenment Now*, Steven Pinker looks at the whole story of human progress and finds good news. We now live longer, healthier, freer and happier lives. Pinker says the real problem is that the ideas of the Enlightenment – using reason (thinking carefully) and science – are being attacked. When speakers and leaders use people’s strong loyalty to their own group, a belief that nothing can change, and mistrust, we risk hurting important systems such as democracy and international cooperation in a way that cannot be fixed.",openai/gpt-oss-120b,gpt-oss-120b_descriptiv,A2_PROMPT_DESCRIPTIVE,A2

Mobile phones have made that situation a bit less believable now. What's the solution to maintain suspense? No phone coverage! If you're a hero in a horror film, it's almost certain that at a key moment, just when you absolutely need to call for help, you will not have any coverage at all.

And now it's happening again to Big Mike's successor – the Cavendish. With its easily transported, thick-skinned and sweet-tasting fruit, the Gros Michel banana plant dominated the plantations of Central America. United Fruit, the main grower and exporter in South America at the time, mass-produced its bananas in the most efficient way possible: it cloned shoots from the stems of plants instead of growing plants from seeds, and cultivated them in densely packed fields.",A2,"In the 1950s, banana farmers in Central America were losing their most profitable banana, the Gros Michel (also called Big Mike). The same problem is now happening to its replacement, the Cavendish. The Gros Michel banana was easy to move, had a thick skin, and tasted sweet, so it was the main banana on Central American farms. United Fruit, the biggest banana grower and seller in South America at that time, made many bananas quickly: it copied small new shoots from the plant stems instead of planting seeds, and grew them close together in the field.",openai/gpt-oss-120b,gpt-oss-120b_descriptiv,A2_PROMPT_DESCRIPTIVE,A2
tsar2025testblind,113-a2,"Spider venom is present in most species and serves the purpose of stunning or killing their prey rather than attacking humans. In fact, only 25 of the known spider species produce venom which can actually harm humans, and although spider bites can be painful, they are rarely deadly. Australia's notorious Sydney funnel-web spider has not produced any fatalities since anti-venom was developed in 1981. However, take care not to rub hairy spiders like tarantulas up the wrong way. When they feel in danger, they defend themselves by ejecting a cloud of urticating hairs. These irritating hairs then embed themselves in the skin or eyes of the attacker.",A2,"Most spiders have venom. The venom is mainly used to stop or kill the animals they catch, not to hurt people. Only about 25 spider kinds have venom that can really hurt humans. A spider bite can hurt, but it rarely kills. In Australia, the famous Sydney funnel‑web spider has not caused any deaths since a special medicine (anti‑venom) was made in 1981. Be careful when you handle hairy spiders such as tarantulas.

tsar2025testblind,115-a2,"If we want to know where our capability for complex language came from, we need to look at how our brains are different from other animals. This relates to more than just brain size; it is important what other things our brains can do and when and why they evolved that way. And for this there are very few physical clues; artefacts left by our ancestors don't tell us what speech they were capable of making. One thing we can see in the remains of early humans, however, is the development of the mouth, throat and tongue. By about 100,000 years ago, humans had evolved the ability to create complex sounds. Before that, evolutionary biologists can only guess whether or not early humans communicated using more basic sounds.",A2,"If we want to know how we got the ability to use many words and sentences, we have to look at how our brains are different from other animals. It is not only about brain size; we also need to think about what else our brains can do and when and why they changed in that way. There are very few physical clues for this; objects left by our ancestors do not show what kind of speech they could make. One thing we can see in the bones of early humans is the shape of the mouth, throat and tongue. Around 100,000 years ago, humans had changed enough to make many different sounds.

tsar2025testblind,116-a2,"It is society, not nature, that tells us girls should favour arts and humanities and leave maths and physics to the boys. Coupled with this is the lack of positive female role models youngsters see doing science-related jobs. Cartoons and stories often show the crazy scientist, genius inventor, or adventurous astronaut as a man. Furthermore, there is an unfortunate perception that scientists are geeky, have poor social skills or that their work is lonely and detached from the rest of the world. These are false stereotypes portrayed by the media, but they may mean that girls do not identify with scientists, and see science as an unappealing career path. If girls saw more positive female role models in science it would give them more confidence and a greater sense of belonging in those subjects.",A2,"It is the way people think, not nature, that says girls should like art and subjects about people (humanities) and that boys should do maths and physics. At the same time, there are few good female role models (people we look up to) that young people see doing science jobs. Cartoons and stories often show the crazy scientist, the clever inventor, or the brave astronaut as a man. Also, many people think scientists are nerdy, have bad social skills, or work alone and far from everyday life.
