Breeding programmes provide a safeguard: zoo-bred animals can be released into the wild to increase genetic diversity.",A2,"One of the most important jobs of zoos today is helping with breeding programs for animals that are in danger of disappearing. In nature, some of the rarest animals struggle to find partners and have babies. They also face dangers like hunters, losing their homes, and other animals that might attack them.

United Fruit, the main grower and exporter in South America at the time, mass-produced its bananas in the most efficient way possible: it cloned shoots from the stems of plants instead of growing plants from seeds, and cultivated them in densely packed fields.",A2,"In the 1950s, banana farmers in Central America had a big problem. Their most popular banana, called the Gros Michel or ""Big Mike,"" was dying. Now, the same thing is happening to the banana that replaced it—the Cavendish.

The Gros Michel banana was very popular because it was easy to ship, had thick skin, and tasted sweet. It grew on big farms in Central America. The main company growing and selling bananas at the time, United Fruit, made them in the fastest way possible. Instead of growing new plants from seeds, they took pieces from old plants and grew them close together in large fields.",mistralai/mistral-medium-3,mistral-medium-3_descriptiv,A2_PROMPT_DESCRIPTIVE,A2
tsar2025testblind,113-a2,"Spider venom is present in most species and serves the purpose of stunning or killing their prey rather than attacking humans. In fact, only 25 of the known spider species produce venom which can actually harm humans, and although spider bites can be painful, they are rarely deadly. Australia's notorious Sydney funnel-web spider has not produced any fatalities since anti-venom was developed in 1981. However, take care not to rub hairy spiders like tarantulas up the wrong way. When they feel in danger, they defend themselves by ejecting a cloud of urticating hairs. These irritating hairs then embed themselves in the skin or eyes of the attacker.",A2,"Most spiders have venom to catch their food, not to hurt people. Only 25 types of spiders can really harm humans with their venom. Even though spider bites can hurt, they are almost never deadly. For example, Australia’s dangerous Sydney funnel-web spider hasn’t killed anyone since 1981, when a special medicine was made to treat its bites.

But be careful with hairy spiders like tarantulas. If they feel scared, they can shoot out tiny, annoying hairs. These hairs stick to your skin or eyes and cause pain.",mistralai/mistral-medium-3,mistral-medium-3_descriptiv,A2_PROMPT_DESCRIPTIVE,A2
tsar2025testblind,114-a2,"This horror film cliché was especially popular with horror films of the late 20th century. It starts with a group of teenagers all enjoying themselves, and it ends with everyone dead except one girl. At the beginning the girl is usually innocent, shy and not particularly strong. By the end, she has become the toughest and most resourceful person in the world. The last girl almost always wins in the end.",A2,"This scary movie idea was very common in horror films from the late 1900s. It begins with a group of young people having fun, and it ends with all of them dead except one girl. At the start, the girl is usually quiet, shy, and not very strong. But by the end, she becomes the bravest and smartest person there. The last girl almost always survives in the end.",mistralai/mistral-medium-3,mistral-medium-3_descriptiv,A2_PROMPT_DESCRIPTIVE,A2
tsar2025testblind,115-a2,"If we want to know where our capability for complex language came from, we need to look at how our brains are different from other animals. This relates to more than just brain size; it is important what other things our brains can do and when and why they evolved that way. And for this there are very few physical clues; artefacts left by our ancestors don't tell us what speech they were capable of making. One thing we can see in the remains of early humans, however, is the development of the mouth, throat and tongue. By about 100,000 years ago, humans had evolved the ability to create complex sounds. Before that, evolutionary biologists can only guess whether or not early humans communicated using more basic sounds.",A2,"To understand how humans developed the ability to use complex language, we need to look at how our brains are different from other animals. It’s not just about the size of the brain—it’s also about what the brain can do and how it changed over time. However, there isn’t much physical evidence to help us. Things left behind by our ancestors don’t show us what kind of speech they could make.

One thing we can see from early human remains is how their mouths, throats, and tongues developed. By about 100,000 years ago, humans could make complex sounds.

tsar2025testblind,116-a2,"It is society, not nature, that tells us girls should favour arts and humanities and leave maths and physics to the boys. Coupled with this is the lack of positive female role models youngsters see doing science-related jobs. Cartoons and stories often show the crazy scientist, genius inventor, or adventurous astronaut as a man. Furthermore, there is an unfortunate perception that scientists are geeky, have poor social skills or that their work is lonely and detached from the rest of the world. These are false stereotypes portrayed by the media, but they may mean that girls do not identify with scientists, and see science as an unappealing career path. If girls saw more positive female role models in science it would give them more confidence and a greater sense of belonging in those subjects.",A2,"People often say that girls should like art and books, while boys should do math and science. This idea comes from society, not nature. Also, young people don’t see many women working in science jobs. In cartoons and stories, scientists, inventors, or astronauts are usually men. Many people think scientists are strange, not good at talking to others, or that they work alone. These ideas are not true, but they make girls think science is not for them. If girls saw more women doing science jobs, they would feel more confident and think science is a good choice for them.",mistralai/mistral-medium-3,mistral-medium-3_descriptiv,A2_PROMPT_DESCRIPTIVE,A2

It is written and produced entirely by students. The survey shows that the newspaper is highly valued by university students and staff for entertainment, cultural enrichment and work experience.

tsar2025testblind,119-a2,"So much of what the speaker said rang true. I honestly believe there's a danger that the more connected we are, the more isolated we feel. I don't think this is such an issue for my generation who've lived without technology for so long. We know how to be alone and, more importantly, we know that it's OK to be alone. But the under 20s are another kettle of fish. They're so busy communicating that they never experience the feeling of solitude and run the risk of not learning how to enjoy their own company. In addition, they're learning conversation through messages that can be edited and changed at the expense of learning the art of real conversation in real time with the person in front of you.",A2,"I really agree with what the speaker said. I think there’s a problem—when we’re always connected to others, we can feel more alone. This isn’t such a big issue for my age group because we grew up without so much technology. We know how to be by ourselves, and we understand that it’s fine to be alone. But young people under 20 are different. They spend so much time messaging others that they never really feel what it’s like to be alone. Because of this, they might never learn to enjoy their own company. Also, they learn to talk through messages that can be edited, which means they might not learn how to have real conversations face-to-face with someone.",mistralai/mistral-medium-3,mistral-medium-3_descriptiv,A2_PROMPT_DESCRIPTIVE,A2
