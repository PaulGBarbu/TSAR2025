In the wild, some of the rarest species have difficulty in finding mates and breeding, and they might also be threatened by poachers, loss of their habitat and predators. A good zoo will enable these species to live and breed in a secure environment. In addition, as numbers of some wild species drop, there is an increased danger of populations becoming too genetically similar. Breeding programmes provide a safeguard: zoo-bred animals can be released into the wild to increase genetic diversity.",A2,"One of the most important jobs of zoos today is helping animals have babies, especially animals that might disappear forever. In nature, some very rare animals have trouble finding other animals to have babies with. They might also be in danger from people who hunt them illegally, losing their homes, and other animals that want to eat them. A good zoo will let these animals live and have babies in a safe place. Also, when there are fewer wild animals, there is more danger that all the animals become too similar to each other. Baby-making programs help with this problem: animals born in zoos can go back to nature to make the animal groups more different from each other.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4,claude-sonnet-4_descriptiv,A2_PROMPT_DESCRIPTIVE,A2

tsar2025testblind,110-a2,"Are things getting worse every day? Is progress an impossible goal? In Enlightenment Now, Steven Pinker looks at the big picture of human progress and finds good news. We are living longer, healthier, freer and happier lives. The real problem, Pinker argues, is that the Enlightenment values of reason and science are under attack. When commentators and demagogues appeal to people's tribalism, fatalism and distrust, then we are in danger of causing irreparable damage to important institutions like democracy and world co-operation.  ",A2,"Are things getting worse every day? Is it impossible to make things better? In his book Enlightenment Now, Steven Pinker looks at how humans have changed over time and finds good news. We are living longer, staying healthier, having more freedom and feeling happier. The real problem, Pinker says, is that important ideas about using reason and science are being attacked. When people who talk on TV and political leaders make people think only about their own group, make them feel hopeless, and make them not trust others, then we are in danger of badly damaging important things like democracy and countries working together around the world.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4,claude-sonnet-4_descriptiv,A2_PROMPT_DESCRIPTIVE,A2

And now it's happening again to Big Mike's successor – the Cavendish. With its easily transported, thick-skinned and sweet-tasting fruit, the Gros Michel banana plant dominated the plantations of Central America. United Fruit, the main grower and exporter in South America at the time, mass-produced its bananas in the most efficient way possible: it cloned shoots from the stems of plants instead of growing plants from seeds, and cultivated them in densely packed fields.",A2,"In the 1950s, banana companies in Central America had a big problem. Their best banana, called Gros Michel or ""Big Mike,"" was dying. Now the same thing is happening again to the banana that replaced it – the Cavendish. The Gros Michel banana was perfect for business. It had thick skin so it was easy to transport, and it tasted very sweet. This banana plant grew everywhere in Central America. United Fruit was the biggest company that grew and sold bananas in South America at that time. They made millions of bananas in the fastest way they could: they copied parts from banana plant stems instead of growing new plants from seeds, and they planted them very close together in big fields.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4,claude-sonnet-4_descriptiv,A2_PROMPT_DESCRIPTIVE,A2

In fact, only 25 of the known spider species produce venom which can actually harm humans, and although spider bites can be painful, they are rarely deadly. Australia's notorious Sydney funnel-web spider has not produced any fatalities since anti-venom was developed in 1981. However, take care not to rub hairy spiders like tarantulas up the wrong way. When they feel in danger, they defend themselves by ejecting a cloud of urticating hairs. These irritating hairs then embed themselves in the skin or eyes of the attacker.",A2,"Most spiders have poison in their bite. They use this poison to stop or kill the animals they eat, not to attack people. Only 25 types of spiders that we know have poison that can really hurt humans.

But no one has died from this spider's bite since doctors made special medicine for it in 1981. But be careful with hairy spiders like tarantulas. Don't make them angry.

tsar2025testblind,115-a2,"If we want to know where our capability for complex language came from, we need to look at how our brains are different from other animals. This relates to more than just brain size; it is important what other things our brains can do and when and why they evolved that way. And for this there are very few physical clues; artefacts left by our ancestors don't tell us what speech they were capable of making. One thing we can see in the remains of early humans, however, is the development of the mouth, throat and tongue. By about 100,000 years ago, humans had evolved the ability to create complex sounds. Before that, evolutionary biologists can only guess whether or not early humans communicated using more basic sounds.",A2,"If we want to know where our ability to use difficult language came from, we need to look at how our brains are different from other animals.

Coupled with this is the lack of positive female role models youngsters see doing science-related jobs. Cartoons and stories often show the crazy scientist, genius inventor, or adventurous astronaut as a man. Furthermore, there is an unfortunate perception that scientists are geeky, have poor social skills or that their work is lonely and detached from the rest of the world. These are false stereotypes portrayed by the media, but they may mean that girls do not identify with scientists, and see science as an unappealing career path.
