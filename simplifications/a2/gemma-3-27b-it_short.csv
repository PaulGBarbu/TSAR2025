These accidents don’t happen often, but boats and trains can both cause bridges to fall down. Trains are dangerous because they move very fast. Boats are dangerous because they are very heavy, even if they move slowly. We can help prevent these accidents by checking bridges for problems, making work safer, and building stronger bridges.

tsar2025testblind,116-a2,"It is society, not nature, that tells us girls should favour arts and humanities and leave maths and physics to the boys. Coupled with this is the lack of positive female role models youngsters see doing science-related jobs. Cartoons and stories often show the crazy scientist, genius inventor, or adventurous astronaut as a man. Furthermore, there is an unfortunate perception that scientists are geeky, have poor social skills or that their work is lonely and detached from the rest of the world. These are false stereotypes portrayed by the media, but they may mean that girls do not identify with scientists, and see science as an unappealing career path. If girls saw more positive female role models in science it would give them more confidence and a greater sense of belonging in those subjects.",A2,"
People, not nature, teach girls to like subjects like art and literature, and think boys are better at maths and science. Also, girls don't often see women working in science. In films and books, scientists are usually men. Some people think scientists are strange and don’t have many friends, or that their job is isolating. This isn’t true, but it can make girls think science isn’t for them. If girls had more female scientists to look up to, they would feel more confident and want to study these subjects.

tsar2025testblind,117-a2,"The Scallion is printed weekly and distributed free in faculty buildings, with a readership of approximately 10,000 students. It is written and produced entirely by students. The survey shows that the newspaper is highly valued by university students and staff for entertainment, cultural enrichment and work experience. The cost of printing newspapers is significant. Furthermore, some students do not have easy access to the paper, since the only way to obtain a copy is to physically go to university. An additional environmental issue is that a large number of copies end up as litter on campus.",A2,"
The Scallion is a student newspaper printed every week. About 10,000 students read it, and students write and make it. Students and teachers like the newspaper for fun, learning about culture, and getting work experience. Printing the newspaper costs a lot of money. Also, it’s not easy for all students to get a copy – they have to go to the university to pick one up. Finally, many newspapers are thrown away and become litter on campus, which is bad for the environment.

tsar2025testblind,119-a2,"So much of what the speaker said rang true. I honestly believe there's a danger that the more connected we are, the more isolated we feel. I don't think this is such an issue for my generation who've lived without technology for so long. We know how to be alone and, more importantly, we know that it's OK to be alone. But the under 20s are another kettle of fish. They're so busy communicating that they never experience the feeling of solitude and run the risk of not learning how to enjoy their own company. In addition, they're learning conversation through messages that can be edited and changed at the expense of learning the art of real conversation in real time with the person in front of you.",A2,"What the speaker said made a lot of sense. I think it’s possible to feel lonely even when you’re always in touch with people. My generation grew up without much technology, so we’re used to being alone and we know that’s okay. But young people today are always communicating. They don’t often spend time by themselves, and they might not learn to enjoy being alone. Also, they practice talking by writing messages, which you can change. This means they might not get good at talking to people face-to-face in real time.

tsar2025testblind,120-a2,"Don't always follow positive feedback with negative feedback. When positive and negative feedback always appear to go hand in hand, the positives can become devalued and ignored. Ensure there are times when positive feedback is given for its own sake and resist the temptation to offer constructive criticism.",A2,"
Don’t always say something good and then something bad. If you always do this, the good things might not seem important anymore. Sometimes, just say something nice. Try not to always find something to improve.
