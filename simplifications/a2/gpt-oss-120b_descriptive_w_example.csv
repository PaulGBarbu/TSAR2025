During his expeditions, Lewis has witnessed this environmental destruction first-hand. He's swum over coral reefs bleached by the increase in water temperature, and observed underwater deserts beneath the shallow waters of the Red Sea, devoid of life and strewn with plastic. Pugh believes that nature can recover if it is given space to do so, but the clock is ticking. If we don't start looking after our seas, we may soon have an unsolvable problem on our hands.",A2,"Lewis wants the number of protected places in the ocean to grow from 3 % to 10 % so we can fix the damage made by people, such as catching too many fish, making the water dirty, and throwing trash.  

During his trips, Lewis has seen this damage himself.  

He has swam over coral reefs that have turned white because the water is hotter, and he has seen empty places under the shallow Red Sea that have no living things and are full of plastic.

We are living longer, healthier, freer and happier lives. The real problem, Pinker argues, is that the Enlightenment values of reason and science are under attack. When commentators and demagogues appeal to people's tribalism, fatalism and distrust, then we are in danger of causing irreparable damage to important institutions like democracy and world co-operation.  ",A2,"Are things getting worse every day? Is it impossible to make progress? In the book *Enlightenment Now*, Steven Pinker looks at the whole picture of human progress and finds good news.

Pinker says the real problem is that the ideas of the Enlightenment – the belief in reason and science – are being attacked. When speakers and leaders use people’s strong loyalty to their own group (tribalism), the idea that nothing can change (fatalism), and mistrust, they can hurt important systems such as democracy and international cooperation.

And for this there are very few physical clues; artefacts left by our ancestors don't tell us what speech they were capable of making. One thing we can see in the remains of early humans, however, is the development of the mouth, throat and tongue. By about 100,000 years ago, humans had evolved the ability to create complex sounds.

Coupled with this is the lack of positive female role models youngsters see doing science-related jobs. Cartoons and stories often show the crazy scientist, genius inventor, or adventurous astronaut as a man. Furthermore, there is an unfortunate perception that scientists are geeky, have poor social skills or that their work is lonely and detached from the rest of the world. These are false stereotypes portrayed by the media, but they may mean that girls do not identify with scientists, and see science as an unappealing career path.

Also, many people think scientists are nerdy, have bad social skills, or work alone and far from everyday life. These are simple, wrong ideas that the media (TV, movies, news) shows.
