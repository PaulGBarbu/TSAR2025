**Model MI:**
Strengths: Preserves the italicization of the book title. Uses simple vocabulary while maintaining meaning. Good simplification of technical terms.
Weaknesses: Changes ""excited to see what RJ Palacio writes next"" to ""excited to read,"" which alters the meaning slightly since it refers to anticipation of future works, not the current book.

Strengths: Clear structure with simple sentences appropriate for B1 level. Uses accessible vocabulary like ""common pets"" and ""take care of them well."" Maintains logical flow.
Weaknesses: Loses the nuance of Chloe having ""lost count"" of explanations, which reduces the emphasis on how frequently this happens.

This is because your subconscious, which is the part of your mind that thinks and feels without you realizing it, can tell you things you need to know.","Some people believe that writing down your dreams can help you have lucid dreams. In a lucid dream, you know you are dreaming, and you can even control what happens. For example, you could change a scary dream into a happy one or decide what happens next, like directing a movie.

But it’s also good to let some dreams happen naturally, so your subconscious mind can show you what you’re really thinking or feeling!","Some people believe that writing down your dreams can help you have more control over them. This control is called “lucid dreaming”. It means you know you are dreaming while it’s happening, and you can even change things in your dream. 

For example, if you’re having a bad dream, you might be able to make it better. Or, you could decide what happens next in your dream, just like a director controls a movie.

Gabriela used to work in a place where people clearly respected those in charge. Everyone knew their role, and leaders made most of the decisions – people didn’t usually question them. This is called a “high power distance” culture, meaning there’s a big difference in power between managers and employees.

However, her new team in Sweden is different. They are used to a “low power distance” culture. This means people work *with* their managers to solve problems and make decisions. Here, leaders help their team members develop their own ideas and *expect* people to share their opinions, even if they disagree. They act more like coaches or advisors than strict bosses.



","Gabriela had previously worked in a company where the hierarchy was strong – people accepted big differences in power and respected the boss’s authority. In that kind of workplace, the boss makes the important decisions and employees rarely question them.  

In her Swedish team, the hierarchy is much flatter. Workers and bosses often discuss problems together and share decisions. Here, the boss acts more like a coach or mentor, encourages people to think for themselves, and expects to be challenged.","In her old job, Gabriela was used to a workplace where bosses had a lot of power and workers always respected their authority.

He feels very nervous, like any child starting a new school. But because of how he looks, it's very painful for him. No one wants to sit near him, and he sees kids staring or whispering about him. Luckily, he makes friends with Jack, a classmate, and Summer, a girl he talks to at lunch. But the first day isn't the only tough part. He finds out that classmates avoid touching him, afraid they'll catch what they call 'the plague.' During the school year, Auggie has many high and low points. Then, a shocking and upsetting event at a school camp changes everything.","**Model LL:**
Strengths: Maintains good narrative flow and includes all key details. Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary while preserving the emotional impact. The phrase ""when they think he's not listening"" adds clarity to the whispering behavior.
Weaknesses: Some phrases like ""serious illness"" may be slightly above B1 level. The text is longer than necessary for the target level.

**Model MI:**
Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1. Maintains the essential story elements and emotional content. Good use of basic connectors.
Weaknesses: Missing spacing after the period in ""at lunch.But"". The phrase ""get sick"" oversimplifies the ""plague"" concept from the original.

**Model GE:**
Strengths: Clear, accessible language with good B1 vocabulary choices. Maintains story coherence and includes key friendship details. Uses ""school trip"" instead of ""school camp"" which may be more familiar to B1 learners.
Weaknesses: The phrase ""catching something"" loses the specific ""plague"" reference that's important to the story context.

**Model GP:**
Strengths: Preserves the original phrase ""behind their hands"" which adds authenticity. Maintains the ""plague"" reference with clear explanation. Good narrative structure.
Weaknesses: Uses ""painful"" and ""strong ups and downs"" which may be challenging for B1 level. Missing comma after ""school year.""

**Model CL:**
Strengths: Uses concrete, simple language. Specifies ""how his face looks"" which adds clarity about Auggie's condition.
Weaknesses: The phrase ""difficult good and bad times"" is grammatically awkward and confusing. Some word choices could be simpler.

**Model QW:**
Strengths: Natural, conversational tone appropriate for B1. Good explanation that classmates ""jokingly"" call it the plague, which adds important context.
Weaknesses: ""Hard feelings"" doesn't accurately capture the ongoing difficulties Auggie faces. Some vocabulary choices like ""appearance"" could be simpler.

**Model DE:**
Strengths: Very concise while maintaining essential story elements. Uses simple, direct language throughout. Good use of basic sentence structures.
Weaknesses: Perhaps too condensed, losing some narrative detail. ""High and low points"" may be slightly advanced for B1.

Strengths: Maintains clear narrative flow and preserves all key story elements. Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary with explanatory phrases like ""big feet"" for hooves. Successfully conveys the contrast between a skilled and unskilled rider's potential troubles.
Weaknesses: ""Big feet"" is an oversimplification that loses the specific meaning of hooves. Some phrases are slightly wordy for B1 level.

**Model MI:**
Strengths: Retains the original's questioning format (""Could the boy ride? Sam wondered""). Uses ""hooves"" correctly while keeping language accessible. Maintains good story progression and all essential plot points.
Weaknesses: ""Land"" instead of ""property"" slightly changes the context. Some sentence structures could be simplified further for B1 level.

**Model GE:**
Strengths: Uses clear, simple language appropriate for B1. Maintains the logical flow from describing the property to considering escape scenarios. Preserves the father-son relationship context.
Weaknesses: ""Hitting the ground"" is less precise than ""kicking"" or ""pawing."" ""Unhappy and wanted to cause trouble"" doesn't fully capture ""bored and rebellious."" Loses some of the original's contemplative tone.

**Model GP:**
Strengths: Includes helpful explanation ""(the hard feet of a horse)"" for hooves, which aids B1 comprehension. Maintains clear cause-and-effect relationships in the narrative.
Weaknesses: The parenthetical explanation disrupts reading flow. ""Get even more trouble"" contains a grammatical error (should be ""get into even more trouble""). Some word choices are awkward.

**Model CL:**
Strengths: Uses accessible vocabulary while maintaining story coherence. ""Bored and angry"" effectively captures the teenager's emotional state. Clear contrast between skilled and unskilled riders.
Weaknesses: ""Hitting the ground with its big feet"" loses specificity. ""Cause problems"" is less precise than ""get into trouble"" for this context.

**Model QW:**
Strengths: ""Pawing the ground"" is more accurate than other models' descriptions of the horse's action. ""Skilled rider"" and ""far from help"" are precise word choices. Ends with ""danger"" which effectively escalates the concern.
Weaknesses: ""Seemed to go on forever"" may be slightly complex for B1. The overall vocabulary level approaches B2 in some instances.

**Model DE:**
Strengths: ""Vast"" effectively conveys the property's size. Maintains the original's structure and questioning tone. Uses ""skilled rider"" appropriately and preserves the escalating concern about different scenarios.
Weaknesses: ""Vast"" and ""property"" may be challenging for B1 learners. Some sentence structures are more complex than other adaptations.

Strengths: Maintains very close fidelity to the original text while using B1-appropriate vocabulary. Preserves the phrase ""fell in love with"" which is suitable for B1 level. Clean, direct translation.
Weaknesses: Retains ""cold weather"" instead of specifying ""very cold"" or ""freezing,"" which loses some intensity from the original.

**Model CL:**
Strengths: Uses clear B1 vocabulary throughout. ""Terrible storms"" effectively conveys the severity. Good use of ""tall mountains"" as an alternative.
Weaknesses: ""New difficult things to do"" is awkward and less natural than ""new challenges."" The phrasing sounds somewhat childish for B1 level.

**Model QW:**
Strengths: Uses ""Mount Everest"" for clarity. Maintains simple sentence structure. Good vocabulary choices for B1 level.
Weaknesses: Changes ""climbers"" to ""people"" in the first sentence, then uses ""climbers"" later, creating inconsistency. ""After school"" is less precise than ""after leaving/finishing school.""

Strengths: Uses simpler vocabulary (""getting very frustrated"" instead of ""frustration,"" ""doing its job"" for ""performing""). Maintains narrative flow and includes all key information.
Weaknesses: ""After a while"" is less precise than ""after weeks."" The phrase ""didn't think he was managing the situation satisfactorily"" becomes ""didn't think he was handling the situation well,"" which loses some meaning.

**Model MI:**
Strengths: Uses B1-appropriate vocabulary (""feeling upset,"" ""working well""). Maintains chronological structure and preserves core meaning.
Weaknesses: ""Feeling upset"" doesn't fully capture ""frustration."" ""Well enough"" is slightly awkward phrasing compared to other options.

**Model GE:**
Strengths: Simplifies opening effectively (""was unhappy with her team""). Uses accessible vocabulary throughout. Adds clarifying detail about disappointment.
Weaknesses: Loses the time reference ""after weeks."" The added sentence about disappointment introduces information not present in the original text.

**Model GP:**
Strengths: Maintains temporal reference and uses appropriate B1 vocabulary. Clear sentence structure throughout.
Weaknesses: ""Only asked"" could imply the manager was dismissive, which may not reflect the original tone. Ending feels slightly abrupt.

Strengths: Maintains clear sentence structure and preserves most original meaning. Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary substitutions like ""groups"" for ""packs"" and ""underground train system"" for ""metro system."" The final sentence accurately conveys that locals don't notice the dogs.
Weaknesses: Slightly wordy in places (""people who use the trains"" could be simpler). The phrase ""especially the locals"" adds unnecessary emphasis not present in the original.

**Model MI:**
Strengths: Concise and clear language appropriate for B1 level. Good simplification of complex ideas while maintaining accuracy. Uses exclamation mark effectively to maintain the original's tone.
Weaknesses: ""Listen to the station names"" is less precise than the original concept of learning to recognize names. Loses some nuance about the dogs' learning process.

**Model GE:**
Strengths: Adds helpful clarification with ""are very clever"" which aids B1 comprehension. Uses ""subway"" as an alternative to metro, showing vocabulary variation. Clear logical flow between ideas.
Weaknesses: ""Small, cute dogs"" loses the comparative aspect (""smaller, cuter""). ""Don't usually pay them much attention"" is less precise than ""travel largely unnoticed.""

**Model GP:**
Strengths: Very concise while maintaining essential information. Preserves the original's final phrase ""almost unnoticed by locals"" most accurately. Efficient use of language appropriate for B1.
Weaknesses: ""People give food"" loses the ""more likely"" probability aspect. Some sentences feel slightly choppy due to extreme brevity.

**Model CL:**
Strengths: Maintains ""humans"" from the original text. Clear explanation of the dogs' behavior and scientific theories. Good use of ""very good"" to simplify ""excellent.""
Weaknesses: ""Underground trains"" is more complex than necessary. ""Have learned to know"" is awkward phrasing. Somewhat verbose for B1 level.

**Model QW:**
Strengths: Adds useful clarification ""to share with the whole group"" which helps B1 comprehension. ""Hardly notice"" is a good simplification of ""largely unnoticed."" Includes ""exactly"" which shows uncertainty appropriately.
Weaknesses: ""Small, cute dogs"" loses the comparative meaning. The added explanation, while helpful, slightly changes the original meaning.

**Model DE:**
Strengths: Maintains formal structure similar to original. Preserves ""possibility"" showing scientific uncertainty. Good balance of simplification and accuracy. Clear logical progression.

Another example is Uber, which encourages people to use their own personal cars as taxis to make some extra cash in their free time.","Many companies have realised that the sharing economy can be very profitable. They want to make money by using resources that are not being fully used. A popular business model is to create an online platform that connects customers with people who can offer a specific product or service. For example, companies like Airbnb help people rent out their empty rooms or houses to others, making some extra money.

Companies are realising they can make a lot of money from the “sharing economy”. This means finding ways to profit from things that people aren’t using fully. 

A popular business idea is for companies to create websites or apps that connect customers with people who offer a service or product. These companies don’t directly provide the service themselves – they simply connect the people who need it with the people who can offer it.

For example, Airbnb is a company that helps people rent out spare rooms or houses. This allows people to earn money from property they aren’t using all the time. Uber is another example. It allows people to use their own cars to give rides to others and earn money. They work like taxis, but use regular people’s cars instead of professional taxi drivers.

Horror movies often use places where no one lives anymore. These could be old, empty hospitals, frightening houses, or towns where people used to live but don’t now. There’s something strange about these lonely, empty places. We might wonder what life was like there before, and why people left. Also, the silence in these places can be really scary. 

It’s also useful for filmmakers that these places are often remote – it’s easy to imagine your phone wouldn’t work there, which makes the story more realistic.

Today there are still civil wars, but countries are mostly co-existing more peacefully than in the past. However, terrorism has shot up in the last few years and, since World War II, wars have killed many more civilians than soldiers. Even for civilians, though, the statistics are not all bad.

Nowadays, although there are still some civil wars, most countries are living together more peacefully than they used to. Unfortunately, terrorist attacks have increased in recent years. Also, since World War II, more civilians (ordinary people, not soldiers) have been killed in wars than soldiers. Despite this, the situation for civilians is not entirely negative. While it's true that people are more likely to die as a result of violent crime (like robbery or assault) than because of war or political conflict, the number of murders worldwide has actually decreased.

It can seem like the world is becoming more violent, but there is also some good news. After World War II, until 1990, there were 30 wars where over 100,000 people died in each one.

However, there has been more terrorism recently. Also, since World War II, more ordinary people (civilians) have died in wars than soldiers. 

But even when we look at deaths of civilians, things aren’t completely negative. You are nine times more likely to die from a regular crime than from a war.

**Model LL**: Maintains clear structure and uses appropriate B1 vocabulary. The phrase ""escaped poverty"" works well. However, ""extremely poor"" might be slightly advanced for B1, and some sentences could be more simplified.

**Model MI**: Uses simple, accessible language throughout. The addition of ""to drink"" after ""clean water"" aids comprehension. The phrase ""are no longer poor"" is clearer than ""escaped poverty."" Maintains good flow while simplifying effectively.

**Model GE**: Shows good B1 adaptation by changing ""developing countries"" to ""poorer countries"" and ""dictators"" to ""unfair leaders."" Adds helpful clarification with ""to drink."" However, ""state"" instead of ""situation"" is less common at B1 level.

**Model GP**: Provides explicit explanation of ""dictators"" in parentheses, which is helpful for B1 learners. Retains ""transformation"" from the original. However, the parenthetical explanation disrupts sentence flow and ""transformation"" may be too advanced for B1.

**Model CL**: Uses very accessible language with ""don't have enough money to live well"" instead of ""poverty"" and ""bad leaders"" instead of ""dictators."" Clearly explains concepts. However, this approach sometimes makes sentences longer and more complex than necessary.

**Model QW**: Uses simple vocabulary and clear structure. ""In very bad shape"" is idiomatic and accessible. Maintains good sentence flow. Some word choices like ""extreme poverty"" could be simpler, but overall maintains clarity.

**Model DE**: Stays closest to the original text structure and vocabulary. Uses ""developing countries"" and ""dictators"" without simplification. While accurate, it doesn't adapt sufficiently for B1 level learners who may struggle with these terms.

Lewis wants more areas in the ocean to be protected – he wants to increase this from 3% to 10% of the world’s seas. He hopes this will help to repair the damage that people are causing, such as catching too many fish, pollution, and dropping litter. Lewis has seen this damage himself during his travels. He has swum over coral reefs that have lost their colour because the water is getting warmer, and he has seen parts of the Red Sea with no life in them, just plastic. Lewis thinks nature can get better if we let it, but we don’t have much time left. If we don’t start protecting our seas, we will soon have a very serious problem that we can’t fix.

**Here's a little explanation of some words:**

* **Coral reefs:** These are like underwater cities built by tiny animals. They are very colourful and full of life.
* **Bleached:** When coral reefs lose their colour, it means they are not healthy. This often happens when the water gets too warm.
* **Pollution:** This means making the environment dirty, for example, by adding harmful chemicals or waste.

116-b1,"It is society, not nature, that tells us girls should favour arts and humanities and leave maths and physics to the boys. Coupled with this is the lack of positive female role models youngsters see doing science-related jobs. Cartoons and stories often show the crazy scientist, genius inventor, or adventurous astronaut as a man. Furthermore, there is an unfortunate perception that scientists are geeky, have poor social skills or that their work is lonely and detached from the rest of the world. These are false stereotypes portrayed by the media, but they may mean that girls do not identify with scientists, and see science as an unappealing career path. If girls saw more positive female role models in science it would give them more confidence and a greater sense of belonging in those subjects.","It's not because of nature, but because of the way society works, that people think girls should focus on arts and humanities, and leave maths and physics to boys. Another problem is that young people don't see many women doing jobs related to science. In cartoons and stories, the smart scientist or brave astronaut is usually a man. Many people also think that scientists are awkward, don't have friends, and work alone, which is not true.

If girls saw more successful women in science, they would feel more confident and more interested in these subjects.","

It’s not natural for girls to prefer subjects like art and literature – society teaches them to. We are often told that boys are better at subjects like maths and physics. Also, young people don’t often see women working in science jobs. 

Often, in cartoons and stories, scientists, inventors, and astronauts are shown as men. There’s also a wrong idea that scientists are strange, not very social, or work alone. These ideas come from TV, films and other media. 

Because of these ideas, girls might not think science is a job for them, and they might not want to study it. If girls had more examples of successful women in science, they would feel more confident and like they belong in these subjects. This would encourage more girls to choose science as a career.
