But to know exactly what a dream means for you, you need to link it to the events and feelings in your everyday life.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""give you ideas,"" ""losing teeth,"" ""naked""). The sentence structure is clear and accessible. Successfully breaks down complex ideas into digestible parts.

Weaknesses: Changes ""insights"" to ""ideas,"" which slightly reduces the meaning's depth. The phrase ""what a dream really means for you"" adds an unnecessary word (""really"") not present in the original. Loses some precision in the final sentence by simplifying the connection concept.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains closer fidelity to the original text structure and meaning. Preserves the phrase ""exactly what they mean"" from the original. Uses appropriate A2 vocabulary while keeping more of the original's nuance. The phrase ""being without clothes"" is more formal but still accessible.

Weaknesses: Retains ""insights"" changed to ""ideas"" like the others, but this is minor. The sentence structure, while clear, is slightly more complex than typical A2 level with longer sentences.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very clear A2-appropriate vocabulary. The word ""link"" instead of ""connect"" provides good variety while maintaining meaning. Maintains the essential meaning of the original text. Good balance between simplification and accuracy.

Weaknesses: Uses ""such as"" instead of ""like,"" which is slightly more formal than typical A2 level. The transition ""But to know exactly"" could be simplified further for A2 learners.

**Ranking Assessment:**
Model 2 maintains the closest fidelity to the original meaning while still being accessible. Model 3 provides good simplification with clear vocabulary. Model 1, while clear, makes the most changes to the original meaning and adds unnecessary words.

Strengths: Maintains clear sentence structure and uses appropriate A2-level vocabulary. Successfully simplifies ""adapted remarkably successfully"" to ""have become very good at living in the city."" Preserves all key information from the original text. Uses ""groups"" instead of ""packs"" which is more accessible for A2 learners.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""born in the wild"" may be slightly confusing in an urban context, though this is a minor issue.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for A2 level. Simplifies ""abandoned"" to ""left behind"" which is more accessible. The phrase ""gotten used very well to"" effectively conveys adaptation. Maintains factual accuracy throughout.

Weaknesses: ""Gotten used very well to"" contains a slight grammatical awkwardness - ""gotten used to...very well"" would be more natural. Minor reduction in detail compared to the original.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and sentence structures. Simplifies ""understand traffic lights"" to ""know how traffic lights work"" which may be clearer for some learners. Maintains the core message about adaptation.

Weaknesses: ""Have changed well to city life"" is grammatically incorrect - should be ""adapted to"" or ""gotten used to."" ""People left"" is incomplete compared to ""people left behind"" or ""abandoned."" Contains the most significant grammatical error among the three models.

A movie is being made, and many people, including me, are excited to see what RJ Palacio writes next.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""facial difference,"" ""popular book,"" ""excited""). Maintains the original meaning accurately. The sentence structure is clear and straightforward.
Weaknesses: ""New Yorker"" is simplified to ""writer from New York,"" which changes the meaning slightly. Uses ""very popular"" instead of explaining the bestseller concept more clearly.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Simplifies complex concepts effectively (""being mean"" for bullying, ""whose face looked different""). Uses present perfect tense appropriately (""has become""). Maintains natural flow while using A2-level vocabulary.
Weaknesses: ""Being mean"" is an oversimplification of ""bullying"" that loses some precision. The phrase ""waiting excitedly"" uses an adverb that might be challenging for A2 learners.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses clear, simple vocabulary throughout. ""Has sold many copies"" effectively explains the bestseller concept in A2-appropriate terms. Maintains accurate meaning while simplifying language.
Weaknesses: ""Who had a face that looks different"" contains a tense inconsistency (past ""had"" with present ""looks""). ""Prizes"" for ""awards"" is acceptable but less precise.

All three models successfully adapt the text for A2 level by shortening sentences, using simpler vocabulary, and maintaining the core message. Model 1 preserves the most accuracy, Model 2 shows good simplification strategies, and Model 3 has a notable grammatical error that affects clarity.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level. Maintains clear sentence structure throughout. Successfully conveys all main ideas from the original text. The phrase ""rats of her own"" effectively captures the meaning.

Weaknesses: Loses some nuance from the original, such as the concept of ""losing count"" and ""patiently tried to explain."" The transition between ideas could be smoother.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains more of the original's meaning, including the concept of not remembering how many times (equivalent to ""lost count""). Maintains the original sentence structure in some places while keeping vocabulary accessible. ""Show love"" is a clear A2-level way to express ""affectionate.""

Weaknesses: ""Feel bad about them"" is somewhat unclear - it could mean feeling sorry for rats rather than disliking them. Some sentences remain relatively complex for A2 level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very simple sentence structure with clear breaks between ideas. Vocabulary is consistently at A2 level. Each concept is presented in a separate, digestible sentence. ""Baby rats"" is clearer than just ""babies"" for A2 learners.

Weaknesses: The formatting with line breaks is unusual and may not be necessary. Loses some of the original's flow and connectivity between ideas. ""Before"" is less specific than the original's temporal relationship.

**Ranking:** [""model_1"", ""model_2"", ""model_3""]

Model 1 provides the best balance of simplification while maintaining natural flow and preserving the essential meaning. Model 2 retains more original elements but at the cost of clarity for A2 learners. Model 3, while very simple, sacrifices too much of the original's coherence and natural sentence flow."

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""hurt,"" ""crashes,"" ""wires""). Maintains clear sentence structure and preserves all key information from the original. The phrase ""helped a little"" effectively simplifies ""had some success.""

Weaknesses: ""Endangered animal"" is less precise than ""endangered species."" The phrase ""let them go back to the countryside"" adds ""back"" which wasn't in the original and could confuse learners about whether baboons originally came from there.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful explanation of ""endangered species"" in parentheses, which aids A2 comprehension. Uses simple vocabulary like ""shocked"" and ""fights."" Maintains factual accuracy throughout.

Weaknesses: ""Local government"" may be more complex than ""city council"" for A2 learners. The parenthetical explanation, while helpful, adds length to an already complex sentence.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very simple vocabulary like ""risky"" instead of ""dangerous"" and ""drive away"" instead of ""chase."" Provides clear explanation of endangered species. Good use of present tense (""get hurt,"" ""die"") which is simpler than present perfect.

Weaknesses: Changes ""electrocuted"" to just ""die because they touch electric wires,"" which loses the specific meaning. ""Lower fights"" is awkward phrasing compared to ""reduce fights"" or ""reduce problems."" The explanation of endangered species creates a very long, complex sentence structure that may challenge A2 readers.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three models successfully simplify vocabulary and maintain the core message. Model 1 provides the most natural flow while keeping information intact. Model 2 balances simplification with helpful explanations. Model 3 uses the simplest vocabulary but has some awkward phrasing and structural issues.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""big IT company,"" ""travel to work,"" ""take time off""). Maintains clear sentence structure and preserves all key information from the original text. The phrase ""talk a lot with my coworkers"" effectively simplifies ""idle chit-chat.""

Weaknesses: The phrase ""I can change my schedule"" doesn't fully capture the concept of project-based flexibility. Some sentences could be slightly more natural for A2 learners.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Good vocabulary choices like ""computer company"" and ""on the internet"" are accessible to A2 learners. The phrase ""talking about nothing"" creatively translates ""idle chit-chat."" Maintains the original meaning while using simpler language.

Weaknesses: ""Each project separately"" is somewhat awkward phrasing. ""Late at night"" changes the time reference from the original ""evening."" The overall flow could be smoother.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""kept going,"" ""grew a lot,"" ""unfairness""). Maintains clear sentence structure and preserves all key information from the original text. The simplification is effective without losing meaning.

Weaknesses: ""Just wanted to create pretty pictures"" slightly changes the tone by adding ""just,"" which wasn't in the original. Minor omission of ""boring"" descriptor for the walls.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Good use of A2-appropriate vocabulary and explains discrimination in simpler terms (""treating people badly because of who they are""). Adds helpful context with ""boring, grey walls"" and uses ""neighbourhoods"" which is accessible vocabulary.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""treating people badly because of who they are"" is somewhat lengthy for A2 level. The explanation, while helpful, makes the sentence longer and potentially more complex.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the contrast indicated by ""but"" from the original text. Provides a clear definition of discrimination in parentheses, which is pedagogically useful for A2 learners.

Weaknesses: The parenthetical explanation ""(treating people badly because of their race, gender, or other reasons)"" introduces vocabulary that may be above A2 level (""race,"" ""gender""). This addition makes the text more complex rather than simpler, which contradicts the purpose of A2-level adaptation.

**Ranking Analysis:**
Model 1 provides the most appropriate A2-level simplification while maintaining fidelity to the original text. Model 2 offers good simplification with helpful context but has some unnecessarily complex explanations. Model 3, while well-intentioned with its explanatory approach, introduces vocabulary and concepts that exceed A2 level requirements.

Strengths: Uses simple sentence structures appropriate for A2 level. Successfully simplifies ""bombard"" to ""show people many things."" Maintains the core meaning while reducing complexity.

Weaknesses: Loses the connection between the two main ideas by removing ""and"" at the beginning of the second sentence. ""Ever"" is less clear than ""ever before"" for A2 learners.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the logical flow between ideas with appropriate conjunctions. Clearly explains ""disposable items"" with the addition ""things you wear only two or three times."" Uses ""people in Britain"" which is clearer than ""British consumers.""

Weaknesses: Retains some complex sentence structures that may challenge A2 learners. The sentence length in some cases approaches the original complexity.

Strengths: Retains the location ""Berlin, Germany,"" uses very simple vocabulary like ""mean"" instead of ""cruel,"" and maintains good sentence structure. Includes the contrast ""Instead of shooting them"" which helps comprehension.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""Only time will show"" is more complex than necessary for A2 level, and ""give food to"" is wordier than ""feed.""

**Model 3 Feedback:**
Strengths: Provides helpful explanations in parentheses for potentially difficult terms like ""city council"" and ""illegal,"" which aids A2 learners. Retains location information and maintains all original content.

Weaknesses: The parenthetical explanations make the text longer and potentially more complex. Uses ""milder"" as a synonym for ""warmer"" which adds unnecessary vocabulary complexity for A2 level.

**Overall Assessment:**
Model 1 provides the most streamlined A2 adaptation with natural flow. Model 2 maintains important details while using very simple vocabulary. Model 3 offers helpful explanations but becomes more complex due to the additional parenthetical information, which may overwhelm A2 learners despite being well-intentioned.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""big idea,"" ""old Greek myths,"" ""fight back""). The sentence structure is clear and straightforward. Successfully simplifies ""classical Greek mythology"" to ""old Greek myths"" and ""labyrinth"" to ""maze.""

Weaknesses: Changes ""futuristic Theseus"" to ""modern Theseus,"" which alters the meaning since the Hunger Games is set in a dystopian future, not modern times. The phrase ""are eaten by a monster"" is slightly awkward grammatically.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful clarification by defining ""maze"" as ""a big, confusing building"" in parentheses, which aids A2 comprehension. Uses appropriate simple vocabulary and maintains clear sentence structure. Preserves the future aspect with ""future version of Theseus.""

Weaknesses: The parenthetical explanation, while helpful, may interrupt reading flow. Some sentences could be more concise for A2 level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Adds geographical clarity by specifying ""the island of Crete."" Uses italics appropriately for the book title. Maintains accurate meaning throughout, including the future setting aspect. The phrase ""a Theseus who lives in the future"" is clear and accurate.

Weaknesses: Slightly more complex sentence structures in some instances. The phrase ""one young man"" adds unnecessary specification compared to simpler alternatives.

**Overall Comparison:**
All three models successfully simplify vocabulary and sentence structure for A2 level. Model 2 provides the most learner support through explicit definitions. Model 3 maintains the highest accuracy to the original meaning while adding helpful geographical context. Model 1 has the most significant meaning change with ""modern"" versus ""futuristic.""

Strengths: Uses simple, clear sentence structures appropriate for A2 level. Maintains the core meaning while simplifying vocabulary effectively (""protecting animals and their homes"" for conservation/habitats). The flow between sentences is natural.

Weaknesses: Loses some nuance from the original, particularly the concept of ""potential"" and ""inspire."" The phrase ""left alone"" is somewhat ambiguous compared to ""abandoned.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Attempts to preserve more of the original meaning, including the inspirational aspect (""make us want to""). Provides helpful clarifications in parentheses for ""behaviour"" and ""illnesses."" Uses accessible vocabulary while maintaining accuracy.

Weaknesses: The opening phrase ""When zoos let people see animals"" changes the emphasis from the original. Uses ""shows"" instead of ""circuses,"" which alters the specific context. The parenthetical explanations may be unnecessary for A2 learners.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very simple sentence structures that are highly accessible to A2 learners. Maintains the key concepts while using basic vocabulary. The progression of ideas is logical and clear.

Weaknesses: The opening ""Zoos let people see animals"" oversimplifies the original concept of ""bringing people and animals together."" Like Model 1, it loses the concept of ""potential"" from the original text.

**Comparison:**

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level, converts numbers to written form which aids comprehension, maintains clear sentence structure, and preserves the main logical flow of the argument.

Weaknesses: Loses the conditional structure of the original opening (""If most people have...""), which changes the tone from hypothetical to declarative. The phrase ""looks similar"" is less precise than the original meaning.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains numerical format while adding helpful clarification in parentheses (""that means we forget most of them""), uses accessible vocabulary, and preserves the statistical information accurately. The explanation of the percentage helps A2 learners understand the concept.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""something we see in a dream can happen later in real life"" alters the original meaning, which discusses coincidental similarity rather than predictive dreams. This creates a different interpretation of the concept.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains the conditional opening structure, provides helpful clarification of percentages using ""out of 100,"" includes the concept of coincidence with explanation in parentheses, and maintains the precise meaning about events being ""followed by"" rather than predicted.

Weaknesses: Uses slightly more complex phrasing in some areas, though still within A2 range. The dash usage might be less familiar to A2 learners than parentheses.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""big asteroid,"" ""blow it up,"" ""push it off its path""). The sentence structure is clear and straightforward. Successfully maintains the key information about HAMMER and the two-stage plan.

Weaknesses: Changes ""PHA"" to ""big asteroid"" without explanation, which loses some technical accuracy. The phrase ""sounds like a movie scene"" is less precise than the original's reference to it actually being a film plot.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains more technical accuracy by keeping ""dangerous asteroid"" closer to the original ""PHA."" Uses appropriate A2 vocabulary while preserving the dual nature of the plan. The sentence ""It sounds like a movie scene – it was in the 1998 film Armageddon"" better captures the original meaning.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""weigh about eight tons"" is slightly less direct than ""eight-ton rockets."" Some sentences could be shorter for A2 level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: None relevant to the translation task.

Weaknesses: Provides no translation of the given text. Completely fails to address the task requirements.

**Comparison:**
Model 2 preserves more of the original meaning while maintaining A2-appropriate language. Model 1 simplifies effectively but loses some accuracy in the process. Both working models successfully explain the HAMMER concept and the conditional nature of the nuclear option. Model 2 better maintains the logical flow of the original text.

Strengths: Provides the clearest explanation of ""fast fashion"" with good detail about why these clothes are problematic. Uses formatting (**bold**) to highlight the key term. The phrase ""made so badly"" is more concrete than ""poor quality.""

Weaknesses: Contains more complex vocabulary (""trendy,"" ""receives,"" ""creates"") that may challenge A2 learners. The sentence explaining fast fashion is quite long and complex for the target level. The phrase ""nature problems"" sounds unnatural in English.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three models successfully convey the main message and reduce complexity from the original. Model 1 maintains the most natural English while simplifying appropriately. Model 2 uses the most accessible vocabulary but has some grammatical issues. Model 3 provides good explanations but uses language that exceeds A2 level in places.

She arrived at the South Pole after forty days, pulling a sled with a tent and all her food in very cold weather and ice storms.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""loves big adventures,"" ""kept going,"" ""very cold weather""). Maintains clear sentence structure and preserves all key information from the original text.

Weaknesses: The opening sentence changes the meaning by focusing on Meagan's personal preference rather than the broader concept of adventurers seeking multiple challenges. Uses ""sled"" instead of ""sledge,"" which slightly changes the original terminology.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Preserves the original opening concept about modern explorers. Includes helpful explanations in parentheses for difficult terms (glacier, sledge). Provides temperature conversion to Fahrenheit. Maintains most original details.

Weaknesses: Contains a grammatical error (""has the highest mountain"" instead of ""has climbed the highest mountain""). The explanation of glacier as ""slow-moving sheet of ice"" may be too complex for A2 level. Some explanations add unnecessary length.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the original opening concept. Includes temperature conversion and simple explanations in parentheses. Uses very accessible vocabulary (""needed help"" instead of ""had to be rescued""). Keeps sentences concise and clear.

Weaknesses: Simplifies ""had to be rescued"" to ""needed help,"" which loses some of the urgency and drama of the situation. Changes ""reached"" to ""arrived at,"" which is acceptable but less precise. The glacier explanation as ""big piece of ice"" is somewhat oversimplified.

**Ranking:**

Now he wants people to think about problems that affect many people. He draws pictures of people who have no home in big cities. He does this so people who live there think about homelessness – not having a place to live.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for A2 level. Maintains the core meaning accurately. The sentence structure is clear and direct.

Weaknesses: Loses the detail ""his home city"" which provides context. Changes ""tries to make"" to ""wants,"" which slightly alters the meaning. Uses ""so"" instead of ""to encourage,"" making the purpose less explicit.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains ""his city, Paris"" which preserves the personal connection. Uses simple vocabulary while maintaining accuracy. The phrase ""people who have no home"" is clearer than ""homeless people"" for A2 learners. Uses ""so that"" which better expresses purpose than ""so.""

Weaknesses: The sentence ""so that the people who live there"" is slightly awkward with the repetition of ""people."" Could be more concise in some areas.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Changes ""painting"" to ""drawing"" consistently, which may be simpler for A2 learners. Uses ""problems that affect many people"" instead of ""social problems,"" making the concept more concrete. Provides a clear definition of homelessness (""not having a place to live""). The explanation enhances comprehension for lower-level learners.

Weaknesses: Changes ""painting"" to ""drawing"" which may not accurately represent the original artistic medium. The final sentence becomes somewhat repetitive with the explanation. Slightly longer than necessary for A2 level.

**Ranking Analysis:**
Model 2 maintains the best balance of accuracy, appropriate simplification, and clarity. Model 3 provides helpful explanations but changes the artistic medium and becomes repetitive. Model 1 is concise but loses some important details and context.

This is not a translation at all. The model completely failed to process the input text and instead provided a generic greeting response. There are no strengths to identify as it does not attempt to translate or simplify the original content.

**Model 2 Feedback:**
Strengths: Uses simpler vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (e.g., ""local governments"" instead of ""councils,"" ""special places"" instead of ""designated areas""). Maintains all key information from the original text. Sentence structure is simplified and accessible.

Weaknesses: The opening sentence changes the meaning significantly - it says governments ""try to stop artists from putting graffiti on any wall"" when the original discusses encouraging artists through designated areas, not stopping them entirely. This creates a logical contradiction with the rest of the text.

**Model 3 Feedback:**
Strengths: Preserves the original meaning more accurately than Model 2. Uses A2-appropriate vocabulary and sentence structures. Includes a helpful clarification ""(street art)"" to explain graffiti. Maintains all factual information from the source text.

Weaknesses: Still slightly alters the meaning in the first sentence by focusing on ""stopping"" rather than ""encouraging"" artists, though less severely than Model 2. The phrase ""randomly on walls"" could have been simplified further for A2 level.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and sentence structures appropriate for A2 level. Maintains the core meaning of the original text. The phrase ""does not stay long"" is clear and accessible.

Weaknesses: Changes ""is from"" to ""comes from"" without clear benefit. Loses the concept of ""exploring different locations"" by simplifying to ""work in many places."" The phrase ""new starts"" is less natural than ""new beginnings.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes helpful clarification of street art with ""(art made on walls in public places)."" Preserves more of the original meaning, including the exploration aspect with ""enjoys going to different places."" Uses ""does not stay forever"" which clearly conveys the temporary nature.

Weaknesses: Changes ""is from"" to ""lives in,"" which alters the meaning slightly. The street art definition, while helpful, is not entirely accurate as it only mentions walls when the text discusses various surfaces.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Adds ""is an artist"" for clarity about Faith47's profession. Provides accurate street art definition ""(art made in public places)"" without limiting to walls. Specifically mentions ""rain, wind"" instead of just ""weather,"" making it more concrete for A2 learners. Uses ""beginning"" which matches the original better than ""starts.""

Weaknesses: Slightly longer sentences in some cases. The addition of ""rain, wind"" adds vocabulary that wasn't in the original.

All three translations successfully simplify the vocabulary and sentence structures for A2 level. They maintain the key concepts of temporary art reflecting life's changes. The main differences lie in word choices, clarifying additions, and how closely they preserve the original meaning and structure.

Strengths: Maintains the technical term ""low power distance culture"" which preserves the original concept. Uses clear, simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level. Covers all main points from the original text in a logical sequence.

Weaknesses: The technical term ""low power distance culture"" may be too complex for A2 learners without additional explanation. The transition between the two workplace cultures could be clearer.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful explanations in parentheses (""a place where the boss is far above the workers"") that aid A2 comprehension. Uses accessible vocabulary throughout. Explains concepts clearly without losing meaning. The phrase ""share ideas"" effectively simplifies the collaborative concept.

Weaknesses: Slightly longer than necessary for A2 level. Some phrases like ""is ready to be questioned"" could be simplified further.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for A2 level. Maintains technical accuracy while simplifying complex concepts. The phrase ""goes around"" effectively replaces ""orbiting"" for easier comprehension.

Weaknesses: Loses the mission context provided in the original's opening. The transition from ""Plans are scheduled"" to ""Scientists plan"" changes the tone but maintains clarity.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Adds helpful context by explaining DART as ""a mission to change an asteroid's path,"" which aids A2 comprehension. Uses accessible vocabulary throughout. The first-person plural ""We plan"" makes the content more engaging.

Weaknesses: Changes the perspective from third person to first person, which alters the original tone. Uses ""partner"" to describe the larger asteroid, which may be less precise than other alternatives.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains clear, simple language suitable for A2 level. Preserves the technical accuracy of measurements and relationships between celestial bodies. Uses ""about"" appropriately to indicate approximate measurements.

Weaknesses: Repeats ""about"" multiple times in close proximity, creating slightly awkward phrasing. Does not provide additional context that might help A2 learners understand the mission's purpose.

The other tribute from District 12 is a boy named Peeta, and Katniss soon finds herself in a complicated relationship with him.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for A2 level. Maintains the original structure well. ""Take her place"" is clearer than ""go instead"" for A2 learners.
Weaknesses: Does not explain what a ""tribute"" means, which could confuse A2 learners unfamiliar with the context.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful explanation of ""tribute"" in parentheses, making the text more accessible to A2 learners. Uses simple vocabulary throughout. ""Says she will go"" is clear and direct.
Weaknesses: Changes ""complicated"" to ""difficult,"" which slightly alters the meaning. ""The main girl"" is less precise than ""heroine.""

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes explanation of ""tribute"" with clear definition. Maintains ""complicated relationship"" from the original text. Uses appropriate A2-level vocabulary while preserving meaning.
Weaknesses: The explanation ""(a person selected to take part in a dangerous competition)"" is slightly longer and may be more challenging for A2 readers than Model 2's explanation.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three models successfully simplify the vocabulary and sentence structure for A2 level. Model 2 and Model 3 both address the key issue of explaining ""tribute,"" while Model 1 leaves this term unexplained. Model 2 uses the simplest explanation but changes ""complicated"" to ""difficult."" Model 3 provides a clear explanation while maintaining the original meaning most faithfully.

Strengths: Uses simple sentence structures appropriate for A2 level. Successfully simplifies ""over the period of a week"" to ""in one week."" Maintains the core meaning while reducing complexity.
Weaknesses: Changes ""will mean you start to remember"" to ""you will remember,"" which slightly alters the causal relationship. Uses ""link"" instead of ""connect,"" though both are acceptable.

**Model 2 Feedback:**
Strengths: Adds ""help"" to clarify the benefit of writing about dreams, making the cause-and-effect relationship clearer for A2 learners. Uses ""also"" to maintain the additive meaning from the original ""too."" Keeps sentence structure simple and accessible.
Weaknesses: Removes the comma before ""because,"" which affects readability slightly. The phrase ""give meaning"" is less precise than ""add meaning.""

**Model 3 Feedback:**
Strengths: Maintains ""add to the meaning"" from the original text, preserving the exact phrasing. Uses ""After a week"" which is clearer than ""over the period of a week"" for A2 level.

This was especially true for old train bridges. The steel wheels and tracks could make a spark, and the spark could set the wooden bridge on fire, making it burn down.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very simple sentence structures with clear subject-verb-object patterns. Vocabulary is basic and accessible (catch fire, sparks, burned down). Breaks complex ideas into separate sentences, making it easier to follow.
Weaknesses: The phrase ""burned the bridge down"" uses a phrasal verb that may be challenging for A2 learners. Creates more sentences than necessary, which could feel choppy.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains good flow while simplifying vocabulary. Uses ""metal"" instead of ""steel,"" which is more basic vocabulary. Sentence length is appropriate for A2 level. The phrase ""burn down"" is simpler than ""burn to the ground.""
Weaknesses: Uses ""built from"" which is slightly more complex than ""made of."" The sentence structure in the second sentence is somewhat complex with multiple clauses.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Breaks down the cause-and-effect relationship clearly. Uses simple vocabulary and maintains the key technical detail about steel wheels and tracks. The step-by-step explanation (spark → set on fire → burn down) follows logical progression.
Weaknesses: Contains the most complex sentence structure with ""set the wooden bridge on fire, making it burn down."" The gerund ""making"" adds grammatical complexity beyond A2 level. Slightly redundant with ""spark"" and ""the spark.""

Strengths: Uses simpler vocabulary effectively (""hard"" instead of ""impossible,"" ""respect"" instead of ""recognition""). Maintains clear sentence structure and good flow. Successfully conveys all main ideas from the original.
Weaknesses: The final sentence loses some impact by dropping ""here to stay"" to just ""will stay."" Some transitions are simplified, making the text feel slightly choppy.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains more of the original's nuanced language while keeping it accessible (""patterns"" for ""trends,"" maintains ""Even if we do not know exactly""). Preserves the emphatic ending ""will stay here."" Good balance between simplification and meaning retention.
Weaknesses: Uses ""street art makers"" which sounds less natural than ""street artists."" Some phrases remain relatively complex for A2 level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful clarification with ""(art made on walls or streets)"" which aids A2 comprehension. Maintains good sentence variety and includes all key information from the original.
Weaknesses: The parenthetical explanation, while helpful, interrupts the flow of the first sentence. Some vocabulary choices like ""recognition"" and ""patterns"" may still be challenging for A2 learners.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three models successfully adapt the content for A2 level while preserving the original meaning. Model 1 uses the simplest vocabulary but sacrifices some stylistic elements. Model 2 maintains better flow and emphasis. Model 3 adds useful clarification but creates some structural awkwardness.

Strengths: Maintains the original meaning accurately, uses appropriate A2-level vocabulary (""scary"" instead of ""frightening""), keeps sentence structure simple and clear.
Weaknesses: Makes a minor change from ""has always found"" to ""always finds"" which slightly alters the tense, adds ""on TV"" which wasn't in the original text.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level, provides helpful context by explaining Vietnam as ""a country in Asia"", simplifies ""pilot"" to ""flew planes"" which may be clearer for learners.
Weaknesses: Changes ""upsetting"" to ""feels sad"" which reduces the emotional intensity, ""keep her safe"" is less precise than ""protect her"", loses some accuracy in the translation of key terms.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides clear explanations with ""US Air Force (the part of the army that uses airplanes)"" which helps A2 learners understand military terminology, maintains most of the original meaning, uses appropriate simple vocabulary.
Weaknesses: Changes ""fought in Vietnam"" to ""served in the Vietnam war"" which is less direct, the explanation of Air Force as ""part of the army"" is technically inaccurate since they are separate military branches, changes ""experience"" to ""time"" which is less specific.

**Overall Assessment:**
Model 1 stays closest to the original text while making appropriate vocabulary adjustments for A2 level. Model 2 provides useful geographical context but makes more significant meaning changes. Model 3 attempts to explain military terms but includes a factual error about the Air Force being part of the army.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for A2 level. Successfully simplifies complex terms like ""endure"" to ""face"" and ""despair"" to ""sad."" Maintains the essential narrative flow.

Weaknesses: Adds unnecessary information by explicitly stating ""the tiger"" which wasn't in the original. Changes ""lifeboat"" to ""small boat,"" losing some specificity. The phrase ""they keep living"" is awkward compared to ""they survive.""

Strengths: Maintains good A2-level vocabulary while preserving more original meaning. ""Rescue boat"" is more specific than ""small boat."" Provides a clear explanation of ""horizon"" as ""the far line where the sea meets the sky."" Uses ""hopeless"" which is closer to ""despair"" than other translations.

Weaknesses: ""Big Pacific Ocean"" adds an unnecessary adjective. The sentence structure becomes slightly complex with the horizon explanation, though still manageable for A2.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Keeps ""lifeboat"" from the original text. Provides helpful clarification with ""(his three belief systems)"" for religions. Offers a clear explanation of horizon. Uses ""stay alive"" which is natural and appropriate for A2 level.

Weaknesses: The parenthetical explanation of religions may be unnecessary and could confuse A2 learners. ""Far-away line"" is less natural than ""far line."" The sentence with the horizon explanation becomes somewhat lengthy for A2 level.

All three models successfully adapt the text to A2 level by using simpler vocabulary, shorter sentences, and first-person narrative voice. They appropriately simplify difficult words like ""exhaustion,"" ""endure,"" and ""despair"" while maintaining the story's core meaning.

Luckily, he makes friends with Jack, a boy in his class, and Summer, a girl he talks with at lunch.  

But it is not only the first day that is hard. Auggie soon learns that his classmates do not want to touch him because they are scared of catching “the plague” (a disease they think he might have).  

During the school year Auggie has many strong ups and downs. Then an unexpected and very sad event at a school camp changes everything.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and sentence structures appropriate for A2 level. Maintains the main narrative flow and key plot points. The phrase ""strong ups and downs"" effectively conveys emotional fluctuations.

Weaknesses: Loses the specific detail ""behind their hands"" when describing how children talk about Auggie. Simplifies ""the plague"" concept to just ""disease,"" removing the quotation marks that indicate it's the children's term. The phrase ""meets his first day"" is awkward and unnatural.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains important details like ""behind their hands"" and preserves ""the plague"" in quotation marks with explanation. Includes helpful clarification ""(a serious disease)"" for A2 learners. Maintains chronological flow with ""After deciding.""

Weaknesses: The phrase ""meets his first day"" is grammatically incorrect and confusing. Uses ""very upsetting"" which may be slightly advanced for A2 level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses clear, simple language throughout. Replaces ""staring"" with ""looking,"" which is more A2-appropriate. Provides helpful explanation of ""the plague"" concept. Uses paragraph breaks that improve readability. ""Quietly"" is a good A2-level replacement for the original phrase.

Weaknesses: Loses some narrative connection by omitting ""As he goes through"" structure. Slightly changes the meaning by saying ""a disease they think he might have"" rather than fear of catching it from him.

All three translations successfully adapt the vocabulary and sentence complexity for A2 level while preserving the essential story elements. Model 3 shows the best balance of simplification and clarity, while Model 2 retains more original details despite the grammatical error.

Strengths:
- Maintains clear sentence structure appropriate for A2 level
- Preserves the main narrative elements and meaning
- Uses simple vocabulary consistently

Weaknesses:
- Changes ""Can I ride?"" to first person, creating confusion about who is wondering
- ""Can I ride?"" should be ""Can the boy ride?"" or ""Could the boy ride?""
- Loses some nuance in the translation of ""rebellious"" to just stating it directly
- ""From where they stood"" is slightly awkward phrasing

Strengths:
- Includes helpful explanations in parentheses (hooves, rider definitions)
- Maintains the questioning structure correctly with ""Could the boy ride it?""
- Preserves the comparative structure in the final sentence
- Uses appropriate A2-level vocabulary

Weaknesses:

Gerlinde Kaltenbrunner from Austria liked mountain climbing when she was a teenager. When she finished school, she worked as a nurse, but she still climbed in her free time.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the word ""climbers"" which preserves the specific meaning. Uses appropriate A2 vocabulary with ""cold weather"" and ""strong storms."" The sentence structure is clear and follows the original closely.
Weaknesses: ""Fell in love with"" is simplified to just the concept without the emotional expression, though this may be appropriate for A2 level.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses ""Mount Everest"" which provides clearer identification for A2 learners. ""Very risky"" is good A2 vocabulary. ""Started to love"" effectively conveys the emotional aspect. ""Spare time"" is appropriate A2 vocabulary.
Weaknesses: Changes ""climbers"" to ""people,"" which loses the specific meaning and makes the sentence less precise.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful clarification with ""people who climb mountains"" and adds ""(the highest mountain in the world)"" which aids A2 comprehension. Uses simple, clear vocabulary throughout.
Weaknesses: The phrase ""people who climb mountains"" is wordy compared to ""climbers."" ""Liked"" is weaker than the original ""fell in love with"" and doesn't capture the intensity of the emotion. The added parenthetical information, while helpful, makes the sentence longer and potentially more complex.

**Overall Assessment:**
Model 1 preserves the most accuracy while using appropriate A2 vocabulary. Model 2 makes good vocabulary choices but loses precision by changing ""climbers"" to ""people."" Model 3 adds helpful context but becomes wordier and loses some emotional nuance.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""wants to climb,"" ""makes it harder,"" ""hurt""). The sentence structure is clear and accessible.
Weaknesses: Changes the meaning by saying she ""wants to climb"" instead of ""decided to climb,"" suggesting the decision is ongoing rather than completed. Uses ""higher than 8,000 metres"" which is inaccurate - the peaks are approximately 8,000 meters, not higher.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the original meaning accurately, including the past tense ""decided."" Correctly describes the mountains as ""8,000 meters high"" rather than ""higher than."" Includes a helpful definition of ""orphans"" in parentheses.
Weaknesses: Retains some complex vocabulary like ""affect"" and uses longer sentence structures that may be challenging for A2 learners.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very simple vocabulary (""walked up,"" ""work badly"") and provides helpful context like the conversion to feet and specific details about the charity's activities. The language is highly accessible for A2 level.
Weaknesses: ""Walked up Mount Everest"" significantly understates the achievement of climbing Everest. Like Model 1, incorrectly states ""higher than 8,000 metres."" Adds information not present in the original text about the charity providing ""food and care.""

This is not a translation at all. The model appears to have completely ignored the translation task and instead provided a generic greeting response. There are no strengths to identify as it fails to address the original text in any way.

**Model 2 Feedback:**
Strengths: Accurately conveys the main message about unused possessions. Maintains all four examples from the original text. Provides helpful explanations in parentheses for potentially difficult terms like ""wool coat"" and ""storage room,"" which is appropriate for A2 learners. Uses simpler vocabulary while preserving meaning.

Weaknesses: The sentence structure remains somewhat complex for A2 level. The parenthetical explanations, while helpful, make the text longer and potentially more challenging to read.

**Model 3 Feedback:**
Strengths: Successfully simplifies the original text while maintaining the core message. Uses more accessible vocabulary (e.g., ""phone"" instead of ""smartphone,"" ""liked"" instead of ""thought was fashionable""). Sentence structure is clearer and more appropriate for A2 level. Maintains good flow and readability.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear vocabulary appropriate for A2 level. Maintains the core meaning effectively. The sentence structure is straightforward and accessible.
Weaknesses: ""Throughout history"" remains unchanged, which may be challenging for A2 learners. The phrase ""came true"" might be slightly advanced for this level.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Simplifies ""throughout history"" to ""all over time,"" which is more A2-friendly. Uses ""predicting the future"" instead of ""prophecy,"" making the concept clearer. Maintains good flow and readability.
Weaknesses: ""All over time"" sounds somewhat unnatural. Uses ""something"" which creates slight ambiguity compared to ""an event."" The phrase ""happened in real life"" is slightly redundant.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very simple language with ""in many times and many places."" Employs ""predicting the future"" for clarity. The phrase ""that thing really happened"" is very accessible for A2 learners.
Weaknesses: ""In many times and many places"" sounds awkward and unnatural. ""Something"" creates ambiguity about what was dreamed. The repetition of ""that thing"" feels clunky.

All three translations successfully reduce the complexity of ""prophecy"" and maintain the essential meaning. Model 1 preserves the most natural flow while keeping language simple.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""let"" instead of ""carry,"" ""fall down"" instead of ""collapse""). Maintains the original meaning while simplifying sentence structure. The phrase ""people watch them very closely"" effectively conveys scrutiny in simple terms.

Weaknesses: ""Mountain gaps"" is less precise than ""mountain gorges"" or ""deep valleys."" The simplification loses some technical accuracy.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful explanation of civil engineering in parentheses. Uses ""deep valleys"" which is more accessible than ""mountain gorges."" Maintains most of the original meaning.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""the work of building big things like roads and bridges"" is somewhat awkward and repetitive since bridges are already the main topic. The opening phrase ""have built bridges"" changes the meaning from ""involved building"" to completed construction.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses short, clear sentences that are ideal for A2 level. Provides a clear definition of civil engineering in parentheses. The structure with separate sentences makes it easier to follow. Uses ""deep valleys"" effectively.

Weaknesses: The sentence ""People check bridges very carefully, especially when a bridge falls down"" slightly changes the meaning - the original refers to scrutiny of engineering practices when collapses occur, not checking bridges after they fall.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three models successfully simplify vocabulary and sentence structure for A2 level. Model 1 maintains the closest meaning to the original.

Strengths: Uses simple sentence structures and basic vocabulary appropriate for A2 level. ""Frustrated for weeks"" is clear and direct. The word ""vague"" is retained, which may be challenging for A2 learners but maintains meaning accuracy.

Weaknesses: ""Vague"" is likely above A2 vocabulary level. The phrase ""handled the situation well"" uses more complex grammar than necessary for this level.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Replaces ""manager"" with ""boss,"" which is more common A2 vocabulary. Uses ""feeling upset"" instead of ""frustration,"" making it more accessible. ""Work together"" is clearer than ""collaborate"" for A2 learners.

Weaknesses: ""Not clear"" is somewhat awkward phrasing. The sentence structure in the final sentence could be simplified further.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains ""manager"" while using simple vocabulary elsewhere. ""Doing a good job"" is very clear A2 language. ""Work better with"" is appropriate for this level. Uses accessible vocabulary throughout.

Weaknesses: Keeps ""manager"" which might be less familiar than ""boss"" for some A2 learners. The overall sentence length in the last sentence could be shorter.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for A2 level. Maintains the key factual information clearly. The phrase ""in danger many times"" effectively conveys the ongoing risk.

Weaknesses: Loses the quantification ""a few thousand"" bites, making it less specific than the original. The sentence structure is sometimes choppy, which could affect reading flow.

**Model 2 Feedback:**

Strengths: Maintains good flow while using A2-appropriate vocabulary. The phrase ""place where the river meets the sea"" effectively explains ""mouth"" for A2 learners. Preserves the temporal sequence well with clear connecting words.

Weaknesses: Uses ""Fortunately"" which may be slightly advanced for A2 level. Like Model 1, loses the specific quantity of bites mentioned in the original.

**Model 3 Feedback:**

Strengths: Provides helpful explanations for potentially difficult concepts (adds mile conversion, defines crocodiles and jaguars). Uses ""tiny stream"" and ""high Andes mountains"" which add descriptive clarity. The phrase ""In the end, he stayed safe"" provides good closure.

Strengths: Clear and concise language appropriate for A2 level. Maintains the key statistics accurately. Uses simple sentence structures that are easy to follow. Preserves the logical flow with ""First"" and ""Second"" transitions.

Weaknesses: Does not explain what credit cards are, which may be unclear for A2 learners. Uses ""landfill sites"" without definition. The connection between the two problems could be clearer.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful explanations for potentially difficult concepts (credit cards, landfill sites). Uses ""UK"" and ""Britain"" interchangeably, showing vocabulary variation. Includes clear definitions in parentheses. Converts ""66 percent"" to ""two-thirds"" for easier comprehension.

Weaknesses: Uses ""tonnes"" instead of ""tons"" inconsistently with other models. The phrase ""for nature"" is less precise than ""for the environment."" Some explanations may add unnecessary length.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses bold formatting to highlight key terms, which aids learning. Provides clear definitions for technical terms. Uses ""the planet"" as a simple alternative to ""environment."" Maintains accurate statistics and logical structure.

Weaknesses: The bold formatting may not be appropriate for all contexts. Uses both ""tons"" and explains ""landfill sites"" but formatting choices seem arbitrary. The phrase ""may not look big"" is less natural than ""may not sound like much.""

All three models successfully simplify the vocabulary and sentence structure for A2 level while maintaining the core message about overconsumption and debt.

Strengths: Maintains clear, simple sentence structure appropriate for A2 level. Preserves most key information from the original text. Uses straightforward vocabulary replacements like ""hard paths"" for ""difficult terrain.""

Weaknesses: Loses the conditional meaning of ""would have been impossible"" by changing to ""could not walk."" The phrase ""find the hard paths"" is less clear than the original meaning of guidance through terrain. Some vocabulary may still be challenging for A2 learners (e.g., ""protest,"" ""charities"").

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Shows good adaptation by replacing ""technology"" with ""tools"" and providing explanations like ""big forest (a rainforest)"" and ""online diary"" for ""blog."" Simplifies complex concepts effectively.

Weaknesses: Changes the conditional structure unnecessarily. ""Big forest"" is an oversimplification that loses the specific meaning of rainforest. ""Children-help groups"" is awkward phrasing. ""Hardest ground"" doesn't clearly convey the concept of difficult terrain.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides comprehensive explanations in parentheses for potentially difficult terms (radio, rainforest, blog, media). Maintains more of the original meaning while making it accessible. ""Collect money"" is clearer than ""raise money"" for A2 level.

Weaknesses: The extensive use of parenthetical explanations makes the text longer and potentially more complex to process. Some explanations may be unnecessary for A2 learners. Changes conditional structure like the other models.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for A2 level. Maintains the core meaning and includes both examples (Airbnb and Uber). The sentence structure is clear and accessible.

Weaknesses: Does not explain what the ""sharing economy"" concept means, which could leave A2 learners confused. The phrase ""resources that are not used much"" is somewhat vague. Missing some context that would help comprehension.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides a clear definition of the sharing economy with concrete examples (room, car). Uses simple language while maintaining accuracy. Explains the concept of platforms as ""website or app"" which is more accessible. Includes the detail about ""good money"" from the original.

Weaknesses: The opening sentence structure ""sharing things can make money"" is slightly awkward. Some sentences are longer than typical A2 level, which might challenge comprehension.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear vocabulary appropriate for A2 level. The phrase ""have babies"" effectively simplifies ""breeding."" Maintains the logical flow of the original text. The term ""families can become too similar genetically"" is accessible while preserving the scientific concept.

Weaknesses: ""Add new genes"" at the end is somewhat imprecise and may confuse learners about genetic diversity. Does not provide explanations for potentially difficult terms like ""poachers"" or ""predators.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful explanations in parentheses for ""breeding programmes,"" ""predators,"" and uses ""hunters"" as a simpler alternative to ""poachers."" The phrase ""family traits"" makes genetic concepts more relatable. Maintains good sentence structure for A2 level.

Weaknesses: Some explanations may be slightly wordy for A2 level. The phrase ""too much the same in their family traits"" is somewhat awkward grammatically.

Strengths:
- Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""fall down,"" ""break,"" ""hits it fast"")
- Maintains the core meaning of the original text
- Clear sentence structure that A2 learners can follow
- Appropriate simplification of technical terms

Weaknesses:
- ""A train can break a bridge because it hits it fast"" oversimplifies the concept and could be misleading about how train accidents occur
- ""New technology"" is less specific than the original ""modern technologies""
- Some nuance is lost in the extreme simplification

- ""Speed of the hit"" and ""great weight"" are clearer than the original technical terms
- Maintains the distinction between the two types of accidents effectively
- ""New tools"" is a good A2-level replacement for ""modern technologies""

Weaknesses:

Strengths:
- ""Happen very rarely"" is natural and clear for A2 level
- Consistent parallel structure with ""For trains"" and ""For boats""
- ""Plan ahead"" is more concrete than ""plan for them""
- Good use of simple connecting words

Weaknesses:
- ""Heavy weight"" is redundant (weight is already heavy)
- ""Bring the bridge down"" is repeated, showing less vocabulary variety
- ""Stop bridges from falling"" changes the meaning slightly from preventing failures to preventing collapse

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and sentence structures appropriate for A2 level. Maintains the core message about relationships and happiness. The term ""self-disclosure"" is retained with a basic explanation.

Weaknesses: Loses the specificity of ""most happy people"" from the original, changing it to just ""happy people."" The phrase ""one close talk is enough"" is unclear and doesn't accurately convey the meaning of having one person for deep conversations. ""Network of other relationships"" may be too complex for A2 level.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Preserves ""most happy people"" from the original text. Provides a clear explanation of self-disclosure in parentheses. Uses appropriate A2 vocabulary throughout. The phrase ""close bonds"" is accessible and accurate.

Weaknesses: The sentence ""One close talk with one person is enough"" still creates confusion about the meaning - it suggests a single conversation rather than an ongoing relationship with someone for deep discussions.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains ""most happy people"" from the original. Provides the clearest explanation of self-disclosure with ""talking openly about personal feelings."" Uses bold formatting to highlight the key term. Clarifies the concept by saying ""one close friend is enough"" rather than ""one close talk.""

Weaknesses: The phrase ""they try to spend time with them often"" adds uncertainty that wasn't in the original, which stated they ""made sure they spent time with them regularly.""

All three models successfully simplify vocabulary and sentence structure for A2 level while preserving the main ideas about relationships and happiness. Model 3 provides the clearest explanation of key concepts, while Model 2 maintains better accuracy to the original meaning, and Model 1 has some clarity issues with key phrases.

But research shows that if we praise the way someone works – the effort, trying new ideas and solving problems – we can help them learn new skills and keep improving their talents.","**Model 1 Feedback:**
Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and sentence structures appropriate for A2 level. Successfully conveys the main concepts of brain plasticity and growth mindset without technical jargon. The examples are clear and accessible.

Weaknesses: Omits the term ""growth mindset"" entirely, which is a key concept from the original text. The phrase ""give praise for"" is slightly awkward phrasing. Some nuance is lost in the simplification process.

**Model 2 Feedback:**
Strengths: Retains the important ""growth mindset"" concept with a clear explanation in parentheses. Maintains good A2-level vocabulary while preserving more of the original meaning. The flow between sentences is natural and logical.

Weaknesses: Slightly longer sentences that may challenge some A2 learners. The parenthetical explanation, while helpful, adds complexity that might be difficult for lower A2 students.

**Model 3 Feedback:**
Strengths: Includes the ""growth mindset"" concept with explanation. Uses clear paragraph breaks that improve readability. The vocabulary is consistently at A2 level. The translation ""noticing small things"" for ""eye for details"" is particularly accessible.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""supports the idea called"" is somewhat awkward. The paragraph structure, while clear, creates shorter chunks that may feel choppy. Some connecting words could improve flow between ideas.

All three models successfully reduce complexity while maintaining the core message. They appropriately simplify technical language and use concrete examples that A2 learners can understand.

The amount of methane goes up and down with the seasons, almost like the planet is breathing.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level. Maintains clear sentence structure and preserves the main scientific concepts. The metaphor about planetary breathing is retained effectively.

Weaknesses: Loses the specific detail ""around it"" when describing what the rover checks. The phrase ""adding more of it"" is less precise than explaining the replenishment concept.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes helpful clarification ""(a basic building block of life)"" which aids A2 comprehension. Maintains the spatial reference ""around it."" Uses clear, simple vocabulary while preserving technical accuracy. Adds ""at different times of the year"" which reinforces the seasonal concept.

Weaknesses: Slightly longer than necessary for A2 level due to the added explanatory phrase, though this may actually benefit learners.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very simple vocabulary with ""does not last very long"" instead of ""only survives."" The phrase ""making more methane"" is clear and direct. Maintains good sentence structure throughout.

Weaknesses: Changes ""found"" to ""saw"" which is less accurate for scientific detection. Uses ""carbon-based molecule"" instead of ""organic molecule,"" which may be less familiar to A2 learners since ""organic"" appears in the original context.

All three translations successfully simplify ""periodically"" to ""from time to time,"" maintain the methane explanation, and preserve the breathing metaphor. They appropriately reduce complex phrases like ""replenishing the supply"" to simpler alternatives.

Strengths: Maintains clear narrative flow and preserves all key information from the original. Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level. Successfully conveys the contrast between the two groups and their different reactions.

Weaknesses: Does not provide definitions for ""growth mindset"" and ""fixed mindset,"" which are technical terms that A2 learners may not understand. The phrase ""could not see how to improve"" is slightly more complex than necessary.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides clear definitions of both ""growth mindset"" and ""fixed mindset"" in bold, making key concepts accessible to A2 learners. Uses formatting effectively to highlight important terms. Maintains the original meaning while simplifying language.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""the belief that a person's ability cannot change"" uses more complex grammar structure. Some sentences are longer than typical A2 level, particularly the definition sentences.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Offers the clearest and most accessible definitions of the key concepts. Uses very simple sentence structures throughout. The phrase ""you can improve your abilities"" is more direct and personal than other versions. Breaks information into shorter, digestible segments.

Weaknesses: Loses some nuance from the original, such as the specific mention that children ""loved challenge."" The phrase ""the test said they were not smart enough"" slightly changes the meaning from feeling judged to the test itself making a statement.

**Overall Comparison:**
All three models successfully simplify vocabulary and sentence structure for A2 level. Model 1 preserves the original content most faithfully but lacks explanatory support. Model 2 provides helpful definitions but uses some complex grammatical structures. Model 3 offers the most accessible language and clearest concept explanations, though with minor content adjustments.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and sentence structures appropriate for A2 level. Maintains the core meaning of the original text. The phrase ""places with no people"" is clear and accessible.

Weaknesses: Loses some nuance by omitting ""scary"" when describing the empty house. The phrase ""it is easy to say there is no phone signal"" changes the meaning from believability to convenience for the director's explanation.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes helpful clarification with ""(a town that no one lives in)"" for ""ghost town."" Maintains the ""scary"" descriptor for the empty house. Uses ""go away"" instead of ""leave,"" which may be simpler for A2 learners. Preserves the believability aspect with ""it feels real.""

Weaknesses: Slightly longer sentences due to the parenthetical explanation, though still within A2 range.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary throughout. Maintains the original meaning well, including the believability factor. Keeps the transition word ""Of course"" from the original. Uses ""town with no people"" as a clear alternative to ""ghost town.""

Weaknesses: The phrase ""old, empty hospital"" adds an extra adjective that wasn't emphasized in the original. Minor redundancy in explaining that quiet can be scary after already stating places are quiet and scary.

All three translations successfully adapt the text to A2 level by using simpler vocabulary (changing ""uninhabited"" to ""no people,"" ""abandoned"" to ""empty/old,"" and ""film directors"" to ""movie makers""). They maintain the questioning structure and core concepts while making the language more accessible.

Strengths: Uses simpler vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""bad person"" instead of ""evil psychopath,"" ""wet"" instead of ""damp""). The sentence structure is simplified effectively.
Weaknesses: Changes ""films"" to ""movies"" unnecessarily. Omits ""usually"" which affects meaning accuracy. Uses ""small stair"" instead of ""staircase,"" which is less natural. Removes the coordinating conjunction ""And"" at the beginning of the last sentence, changing the text flow.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the original meaning most accurately, including ""usually"" and the ""And"" conjunction. Uses ""narrow staircase"" which preserves the original phrasing while remaining accessible. Keeps the emphasis words ""always"" in appropriate places.
Weaknesses: Uses ""movies"" instead of ""films."" The vocabulary simplification is less extensive than other models, though still appropriate for A2.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Simplifies vocabulary appropriately (""bad person,"" ""wet""). Maintains the coordinating conjunction ""And"" and most of the original structure. Keeps important emphasis words like ""always.""
Weaknesses: Changes ""usually"" to ""often,"" which slightly alters the meaning. Uses ""small stair"" instead of ""staircase,"" which sounds unnatural in English.

**Key Differences:**
All models appropriately simplify ""evil psychopath"" to ""bad person"" and ""damp"" to ""wet."" The main distinctions lie in maintaining original meaning (""usually"" vs ""often""), natural phrasing (""staircase"" vs ""stair""), and preserving text flow (keeping or removing conjunctions).

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for A2 level. Successfully simplifies ""augmenting"" to ""adding things to"" and breaks down ""audiovisual perception"" into ""hearing, sight."" The sentence structure is straightforward and accessible.

Weaknesses: Omits ""Personally"" from the opening, losing some of the original's conversational tone. The final sentence removes ""more and more"" which slightly changes the emphasis on increasing commonality.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the conversational tone with ""I think it's very interesting."" Changes ""evolution as a species"" to ""human development,"" which is more accessible for A2 learners. Preserves the conjunction ""and this idea will become more common"" maintaining the original's flow.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""hearing and sight, and memory"" creates awkward punctuation with multiple ""and"" conjunctions. The sentence structure in the final part could be clearer.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very simple vocabulary and sentence structures suitable for A2 level. Adds ""small"" before computer, which helps visualization. Changes ""speed up our evolution"" to ""make our human development faster,"" using more basic vocabulary.

Strengths: Simplifies the idiom ""hit the nail on the head"" to ""said some very true things,"" which is appropriate for A2 level. Uses clear, simple vocabulary throughout. Maintains the main ideas about parental influence and multitasking behavior.

Weaknesses: Changes ""sit together in silence"" to just ""sit together,"" losing an important detail about the ironic nature of the situation. The phrase ""talks on their phone in a different conversation"" is less precise than the original meaning.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains the concept of silence in the final scene. Uses A2-appropriate vocabulary while keeping the core message intact. The phrase ""go back and forth"" effectively conveys the switching behavior.

Weaknesses: ""Was exactly right"" is a somewhat awkward translation of the idiom. ""Posting on the internet"" is less specific than ""social media."" The ending ""talks on their phone"" doesn't clearly convey that these are separate online conversations.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains ""social media"" terminology, which is commonly understood. Includes ""silence"" in the final description. Uses ""face-to-face"" which clearly contrasts with online communication. The ending ""talks on their phone with different people online"" most accurately captures the original meaning.

Weaknesses: ""Said exactly the right things about a few topics"" is a less natural translation of the idiom. The sentence structure is occasionally more complex than typical A2 level.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear sentence structures appropriate for A2 level. Maintains the core meaning of the original text. Uses accessible vocabulary like ""combined"" and ""paying attention.""
Weaknesses: Loses some nuance from the original, such as the phrase ""once too often"" and ""doing the trick."" The connection between mountaineering and changing attitudes could be clearer.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes helpful explanations in parentheses for potentially difficult terms like ""humanitarian projects"" and ""campaign."" Uses paragraph breaks to improve readability. Maintains clear, simple sentence structure.
Weaknesses: The parenthetical explanations may interrupt reading flow. Some phrases like ""put together two things she loves"" are slightly awkward. The explanatory additions make the text longer than necessary for A2 level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very simple vocabulary and sentence structures. Clearly explains the geographic context of Bangladesh. Makes the cause-and-effect relationship explicit with ""so she mixed two things she loves.""
Weaknesses: Oversimplifies some concepts, potentially losing meaning. ""Help projects"" is less precise than ""humanitarian campaigns."" The phrase ""Her project is working"" changes the meaning slightly from ""campaign seems to be doing the trick."" Some connections between ideas could be clearer.

All three translations successfully reduce complexity for A2 learners, but they handle explanations and clarity differently. Model 1 provides the most faithful translation while maintaining simplicity. Model 2 adds helpful context but may overcomplicate with explanations. Model 3 uses the simplest language but sacrifices some precision and detail.

Weaknesses: Does not provide explanations for potentially difficult terms like ""dictators"" or ""poverty,"" which A2 learners may not understand. The transition word ""But"" could be strengthened for better flow.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes helpful explanations in parentheses for ""dictators"" and clarifies ""poverty"" as ""very little money."" Maintains factual accuracy and uses appropriate A2 vocabulary. Good use of transition word ""Also.""
Weaknesses: The explanation ""leaders who use force"" for dictators may be incomplete, as it doesn't capture the full meaning of authoritarian rule.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides the most comprehensive explanations with parenthetical definitions for both ""poverty"" and ""dictators.""

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""covering up,"" ""soften,"" ""support""). The sentence structure is clear and straightforward. Successfully conveys the main concept of the feedback sandwich technique.

Weaknesses: Contains a significant factual error - states that negative feedback is placed between positive comments, when the original describes positive feedback sandwiching negative feedback. This reverses the core concept being explained.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the correct structure of the feedback sandwich (negative between two positive comments). Uses accessible A2-level vocabulary while preserving the original meaning. Sentence length is appropriate for the target level.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""add some good feeling"" is somewhat awkward and less precise than the original concept of ""inject positivity."" Some sentences could be shorter for better A2 comprehension.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple, clear vocabulary suitable for A2 learners. Correctly identifies the sandwich structure. The word ""praise"" effectively replaces ""encourage"" while maintaining meaning. Sentence structure is generally appropriate for the level.

Weaknesses: Like Model 1, contains the same critical factual error by stating negative comments go between positive ones, which contradicts the original text's meaning. The phrase ""good words"" is less precise than ""positive feedback.""

Strengths: Maintains clear, simple language appropriate for A2 level. Preserves the key message and structure of the original text. Uses accessible vocabulary like ""scary movie"" instead of ""terrifying"" and ""guard robots"" for ""sentry robots.""

Weaknesses: Loses the specific reference to ""Campaign to Stop Killer Robots"" by not explaining what this organization is. The term ""murderbots"" appears in quotes but without explanation of why this unusual word is used.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful explanation of ""autonomous"" which aids A2 comprehension. Breaks down complex concepts into simpler parts. Explains the Campaign as ""a group that wants to stop killer robots"" making it more accessible. Uses clear paragraph breaks for better readability.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""steps on heads"" is less clear than ""steps on people's heads."" Some sentences become slightly awkward in the simplification process.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very clear, simple language throughout. Explains the Campaign in accessible terms. The phrase ""steps on people's heads"" is clearer than Model 2's version. Maintains good flow while simplifying vocabulary.

Weaknesses: Removes the term ""murderbots"" entirely, which was a key concept in the original. Loses some of the technical specificity by not explaining ""autonomous"" as a concept. The simplification sometimes removes important nuances.

**Overall Assessment:**
Model 2 provides the most comprehensive A2-level adaptation by explaining technical terms like ""autonomous"" while maintaining the key concepts.

Pinker says the real problem is that the ideas of the Enlightenment – the belief in reason and science – are being attacked. When speakers and leaders use people’s strong loyalty to their own group (tribalism), the idea that nothing can change (fatalism), and mistrust, they can hurt important systems such as democracy and international cooperation. This damage can be hard or impossible to fix.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for A2 level. Maintains the core message and structure of the original text. Successfully simplifies ""commentators and demagogues"" to ""speakers and leaders.""

Weaknesses: Loses the concept of ""irreparable damage"" by using only ""hurting."" Does not explain the complex terms ""tribalism,"" ""fatalism,"" or ""Enlightenment values,"" which may be difficult for A2 learners to understand.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful explanations for difficult concepts, such as ""reason (thinking carefully)"" and defines tribalism as ""strong loyalty to their own group."" Includes the important concept of irreparable damage with ""in a way that cannot be fixed."" Uses A2-appropriate vocabulary while maintaining meaning.

Weaknesses: The sentence structure becomes somewhat complex when explaining multiple concepts. The phrase ""whole story of human progress"" is less precise than ""big picture.""

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides clear definitions for all three complex terms in parentheses: tribalism, fatalism, and explains Enlightenment values as ""belief in reason and science."" Maintains the concept of serious, lasting damage with ""hard or impossible to fix."" Uses appropriate paragraph breaks for readability.

Weaknesses: The final sentences become longer and more complex, which may challenge A2 readers. Some explanatory phrases add length that could affect comprehension.

All three models successfully adapt the text to A2 level by using simpler vocabulary and shorter sentences. Model 1 prioritizes simplicity but sacrifices some meaning. Model 2 balances explanation with accessibility. Model 3 provides the most complete explanations but at the cost of some sentence complexity.

Strengths:
- Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""losing,"" ""ruled,"" ""copying"")
- Maintains the chronological structure of the original
- Correctly identifies the geographic region and time period
- Simplifies complex concepts like ""cloned shoots"" to ""copying shoots""

Weaknesses:
- Contains a geographical error: states United Fruit was in ""South America"" when the context suggests Central America
- ""Ruled the plantations"" is somewhat informal but still comprehensible
- Some sentence structures could be further simplified

**Model 2 Analysis:**

Strengths:
- Uses A2-appropriate vocabulary throughout

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for A2 level. Maintains factual accuracy throughout. The phrase ""throw out tiny irritating hairs"" is accessible vocabulary.
Weaknesses: Loses some specificity from the original text. The phrase ""rub up the wrong way"" is completely omitted, which removes the idiomatic warning. The explanation of what anti-venom is gets simplified to just ""made.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful clarification by explaining anti-venom as ""special medicine"" in parentheses. Uses appropriate A2 vocabulary like ""spray a cloud"" which maintains the original meaning. Includes the handling context that was in the original.
Weaknesses: The phrase ""stop or kill the animals they catch"" is slightly awkward phrasing. ""Famous"" for the Sydney funnel-web spider may not capture the ""notorious"" connotation from the original.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""movie idea,"" ""having fun,"" ""clever""). Maintains clear sentence structure and preserves the main narrative flow.
Weaknesses: ""Late 1900s"" may be confusing for A2 learners compared to ""late 20th century."" Omits ""in the world"" from the original comparison, slightly reducing the emphasis.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Effectively translates ""cliché"" to ""common idea in scary movies,"" which is more accessible. Retains the complete sentence structure from the original, including ""and it ends with everyone dead except one girl."" Uses A2-appropriate vocabulary throughout.
Weaknesses: ""Late 1900s"" time reference may still be unclear for some A2 learners. Minor punctuation inconsistency with missing comma before ""and not very strong.""

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides the clearest time reference with ""movies made in the late 1900s,"" making the temporal context more explicit. Uses simple, accessible vocabulary. Maintains good sentence flow and structure.
Weaknesses: Contains a punctuation error (missing comma in ""innocent, shy and not very strong""). The phrase ""movies made in"" creates slight redundancy.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear vocabulary appropriate for A2 level. Maintains the original meaning accurately. Sentence structure is straightforward and accessible. The phrase ""scientists can only guess"" is well-adapted for the target level.

Weaknesses: ""Complex language"" is simplified to just mentioning complexity without explaining what this means. Some technical concepts like ""evolutionary biologists"" are simplified to just ""scientists,"" which loses some specificity.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides good explanation of complex language as ""ability to use many words and sentences."" Includes helpful clarification like ""scientists who study how living things change"" for evolutionary biologists. Maintains chronological information accurately.

Weaknesses: Some phrases are slightly wordy for A2 level, such as ""changed enough to make many different sounds."" The sentence structure occasionally becomes complex with multiple clauses.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very simple vocabulary throughout. Explains technical terms clearly, such as ""scientists who study how animals change."" The phrase ""grown the ability"" is accessible language for describing evolution.

Weaknesses: Oversimplifies ""complex language"" to just ""skill to use many words,"" losing the concept of complexity. Uses ""brain"" (singular) instead of ""brains"" (plural), changing the original meaning. ""Old objects"" and ""old human remains"" is repetitive and less precise than the original terminology.

Ensure there are times when positive feedback is given for its own sake and resist the temptation to offer constructive criticism.",gpt-oss-120b,"Don't always put negative feedback after positive feedback. If you always mix them, the good comments can be ignored. Make sure you give positive feedback by itself and try not to add criticism right away.","Don’t always give a negative comment after a positive one. If you always mix good and bad comments, the good ones can seem less important and be ignored. Make sure you sometimes give good comments just because they are good, and try not to feel the urge to add helpful criticism.","Don’t always put a bad comment after a good comment. If you always add a bad comment right after a good one, the good comments can seem less important and people may ignore them. Make sure you sometimes give good comments just because they are good, and try not to add a helpful criticism at the same time.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""good comments,"" ""by itself""). The sentence structure is clear and straightforward. Successfully conveys the main message about separating positive and negative feedback.

Weaknesses: Loses the nuanced concept of ""constructive criticism"" by simply calling it ""criticism."" The phrase ""right away"" slightly changes the meaning from the original's emphasis on avoiding the pairing altogether.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains more of the original's meaning by including ""just because they are good."" Uses A2-appropriate vocabulary while preserving the concept of ""helpful criticism."" The phrase ""feel the urge"" effectively translates ""resist the temptation.""

Weaknesses: The sentence structure is slightly more complex than typical A2 level. Some phrases like ""seem less important"" might be challenging for A2 learners.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very simple vocabulary (""bad comment,"" ""good comment"") that is highly accessible for A2 learners. Clearly explains the consequence that ""people may ignore them."" Maintains the core message effectively.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""at the same time"" doesn't fully capture the original meaning about avoiding the pattern of always pairing feedback types. Uses ""helpful criticism"" which may be too advanced for A2 level.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three translations successfully simplify the original text for A2 level learners. Model 2 preserves the most nuanced meaning while remaining accessible. Model 1 provides good clarity but loses some precision. Model 3 uses the simplest vocabulary but has some meaning gaps.
