Dreams can tell you things about what you think and feel, even if you don’t know it. Many people have similar dreams, like flying, falling, losing teeth, or being without clothes in public. These dreams usually have a similar meaning for most people. But to understand *your* dreams, think about what happens in your life and how you feel each day.



","Dreams can tell you things about yourself, things you didn’t even know you were thinking about. Lots of people have similar dreams, like flying or falling.

Your dreams can tell you things about yourself, things you didn’t know you were thinking about. Many people have similar dreams, like flying or falling. Others dream their teeth fall out, or they are in public without any clothes. These dreams probably have a similar meaning for most people. But to understand what your dreams mean for *you*, you need to think about what is happening in your life and how you feel each day.



","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and clear sentence structure appropriate for A2 level. Successfully conveys the main ideas about dreams revealing subconscious thoughts and the need to connect dreams to daily life.
Weaknesses: The phrase ""even if you don't know it"" is somewhat awkward and could be clearer. The transition between ideas could be smoother.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains good A2-level vocabulary while preserving most of the original meaning. The addition of ""Try to connect your dream to those things"" provides helpful clarification that makes the advice more actionable. Uses ""naked"" which is more direct than circumlocutions.
Weaknesses: Slightly longer sentences that approach the upper limit of A2 complexity. The phrase ""things you didn't even know you were thinking about"" maintains some complexity from the original.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very clear, simple language throughout. The sentence ""Others dream their teeth fall out, or they are in public without any clothes"" breaks down the dream examples effectively. Good use of ""for *you*"" to emphasize personalization.
Weaknesses: The phrase ""you need to think about"" is slightly more demanding than the gentler suggestions in other versions. Some sentences could flow better between ideas.

All three translations successfully reduce the complexity of the original text and maintain the core message about dream interpretation and connecting dreams to daily experiences. They appropriately simplify vocabulary while preserving the essential meaning about common dream symbols and personal interpretation.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for A2 level. Successfully simplifies complex concepts like ""abandoned by their owners"" to ""were once pets."" Maintains all key information from the original text.

Weaknesses: The opening lacks the comparative element (""one of the most interesting cases"") from the original. The phrase ""very good at living in the city"" is somewhat vague compared to explaining adaptation.

**Model 2 Feedback:**
Strengths: Retains the interesting/engaging tone from the original. Uses clear A2-level vocabulary and explains ""packs"" as ""groups."" Includes helpful explanation of traffic lights in parentheses.

Weaknesses: The parenthetical explanation of traffic lights may be unnecessary for A2 learners and adds complexity. ""Used to have homes but were left by their owners"" is slightly awkward phrasing.

They are also making a movie of the book. Many people, including me, are excited to see what RJ Palacio will write next.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for A2 level. Successfully conveys the main ideas about the book's popularity, awards, and educational use. The sentence structure is straightforward and accessible.

Weaknesses: Omits that RJ Palacio is specifically a ""New Yorker"" writer, only mentioning ""from New York."" Changes ""facial deformities"" to the vague ""looked different,"" losing some specificity. Alters the ending focus from anticipating the author's next work to the film adaptation.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains more detail from the original, including the specific mention of facial formation differences. Correctly identifies RJ Palacio as American. Preserves the original ending about anticipating the author's next work.

Weaknesses: Contains a significant error by stating schools use the book to talk about ""being unkind to others"" instead of discussing bullying or kindness, which misrepresents the book's educational purpose. Uses slightly more complex phrasing in some areas.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides clear, simple language suitable for A2 level. Accurately conveys the book's educational use for discussing kindness and acceptance. Maintains the correct focus on anticipating the author's future work. Preserves most key information from the original.

Weaknesses: Simplifies ""facial deformities"" to ""different face,"" though this remains understandable. Uses ""will write"" instead of ""writes,"" creating a minor tense inconsistency with the original's present tense.

**Ranking:**
[""model_3"", ""model_1"", ""model_2""]

Model 3 ranks highest due to accurate content representation and appropriate A2 language level. Model 1 follows with good simplification but some content omissions. Model 2 ranks lowest due to the significant error about the book's educational purpose, despite maintaining more original details."

Last year, Martin’s rat had babies, and Chloe wanted to have two of them.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and sentence structures appropriate for A2 level. Successfully conveys the main story points. The phrase ""care for them well"" is clear and accessible.

Weaknesses: Loses some nuance from the original text. The phrase ""has lost count of the times she's patiently tried to explain"" becomes simply ""has often explained,"" removing the sense of repetition and patience. The transition between sentences feels somewhat abrupt.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains good flow between ideas with appropriate connectors like ""But"" and ""Then."" The phrase ""at first either"" adds helpful clarification about the timing of Chloe's attitude change. Vocabulary remains at A2 level while preserving most of the original meaning.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""she's explained to many people"" doesn't fully capture the repetitive nature implied in ""lost count of the times."" Some of the original's emphasis on patience is lost.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains more of the original phrasing, including ""has lost count of how many times,"" which better preserves the sense of frequent repetition. Uses ""take care of them well"" which is clear for A2 learners. Maintains the logical flow of the narrative.

Weaknesses: The sentence ""She has lost count of how many times she has explained"" is slightly more complex than typical A2 level due to the embedded clause structure. The phrase ""wanted to have"" at the end is slightly more formal than necessary.

Strengths: Uses very simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for A2 level. The core message is clear and accessible.
Weaknesses: Oversimplifies key information, losing important details. ""Problems"" is too vague compared to the specific dangers mentioned. ""There aren't many of them left"" doesn't convey the technical meaning of ""endangered species."" The explanation of the monitors' work lacks specificity about their methods.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains most original details while using A2-appropriate vocabulary. Provides a clear explanation of ""endangered species"" with the parenthetical definition. Uses accessible synonyms like ""risky"" and ""electric shocks."" Preserves the nuanced outcome of the policy.
Weaknesses: ""Hired people called Baboon Monitors"" is slightly awkward phrasing. Some sentences approach the upper limit of complexity for A2 level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains all key information from the original text. Uses clear, simple vocabulary while maintaining accuracy. The explanation ""which means there are not many left"" flows naturally. Preserves specific details about both dangers and solutions.
Weaknesses: Some sentences are relatively long for A2 level. The phrase ""This plan has worked a little"" could be clearer about the limited success.

**Comparative Assessment:**
Model 1 sacrifices too much content for simplicity, making it less informative. Model 2 provides good detail with appropriate simplification and helpful explanations. Model 3 maintains the most complete information while still being accessible, though with slightly more complex sentence structures.

Strengths: Good paragraph structure that breaks up the text logically. Uses clear A2-level vocabulary (""using the internet,"" ""one after another""). ""Go to the doctor"" is a reasonable simplification of ""dentist appointment."" Maintains the contrast between advantages and disadvantages.

Weaknesses: ""Different jobs, one after another"" doesn't clearly convey project-based work. The phrase structure in some sentences could be clearer.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Excellent paragraph organization with clear topic separation. Uses appropriate A2 vocabulary while maintaining meaning accuracy. ""Take time off easily"" preserves the original meaning better than other versions. Explicitly states ""it also has a bad side"" which helps A2 learners understand the contrast.

Weaknesses: ""Go to the doctor"" generalizes the specific ""dentist"" reference, though this is minor. Some sentences could be slightly shorter for A2 level.

Strengths: Provides clear explanations with phrases like ""killing wild pigs with guns"" which helps A2 learners understand the context. Uses paragraph breaks to organize information logically. Explicitly mentions ""city government"" and ""protested,"" maintaining key details from the original.

Weaknesses: Slightly longer sentences in some places may challenge A2 readers. The phrase ""keep the pigs in certain areas"" misinterprets the original meaning of the fences, which are meant to keep pigs out, not contain them.

**Model 3 Feedback:**
Strengths: Maintains most key information including ""city council"" and ""protested."" Uses accessible vocabulary throughout. The phrase ""We will see if this works"" is a natural A2-level translation of ""Time will tell.""

Weaknesses: The phrase ""building fences to stop the pigs"" is somewhat vague about what the fences actually do. Could benefit from clearer explanation of the fence purpose.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three models successfully adapt the text to A2 level vocabulary and sentence structure. Model 2 provides the most comprehensive information while remaining accessible, though it contains a minor misinterpretation. Model 3 maintains good accuracy and readability. Model 1 is the most simplified but loses some important details.

In the beginning of Star Wars, Luke lives a normal life with his aunt and uncle, fixing robots. When he finds a message for Obi-Wan Kenobi inside the robot R2D2, this is the start of his adventure. It’s what makes him begin his journey.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""normal life,"" ""big adventure,"" ""fixing robots""). The sentence structure is straightforward and accessible. Successfully explains the concept of ""the call to adventure"" in simple terms.

Weaknesses: Changes ""film directors"" to ""film directors"" inconsistently, then uses both terms. The phrase ""It 'calls' him to begin his journey"" is somewhat awkward and may confuse A2 learners. Omits some details like Luke's full name initially and the farm setting.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains consistent terminology with ""movie makers."" Provides clear explanations with phrases like ""it's like a signal telling him to begin his journey."" Uses appropriate A2 vocabulary throughout. Includes italicization of ""Star Wars"" which shows attention to formatting.

Weaknesses: The explanation ""it's like a signal"" adds interpretation not present in the original text. The sentence structure in the final paragraph becomes somewhat complex for A2 level with multiple clauses.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for A2 level. Maintains good flow between sentences. The phrase ""It's what makes him begin his journey"" is direct and easy to understand. Keeps the essential information while simplifying effectively.

Weaknesses: Uses ""film makers"" instead of ""film directors,"" which changes the original meaning slightly. The sentence ""But then, something happens that makes them go on an adventure and their life changes"" could be clearer with better punctuation or structure.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three models successfully adapt the text to A2 level by using simpler vocabulary and shorter sentences. Model 2 provides the most detailed explanation but risks being too complex. Model 3 offers the clearest and most natural flow. Model 1 has some awkward phrasing that could confuse learners.

44-a2,"Around the 18th and 19th centuries two main ideas about dreams became popular. One was the idea that the things we see in our dreams represent things hidden from our conscious mind. Freud believed that if we understand what dreams are telling us, we can understand our hidden feelings and the problems they cause. However, the other theory was the opposite. It said that dreams are just a collection of random activity in the brain while it's organising memories and events from the day. When we wake up, we try to make sense of these random images and feelings and put them into some sort of story.",gemma-3-27b-it,"
In the 1700s and 1800s, people started thinking about dreams in two main ways. Some thought dreams showed hidden feelings and problems. A doctor called Freud believed understanding dreams could help us understand ourselves. But others thought dreams were just random thoughts from the brain while we sleep. They believed our brains try to create a story from these random thoughts when we wake up.



","
Between the 1700s and 1800s, people started to have two main ideas about dreams. One idea was that dreams show things we don’t fully know about ourselves – feelings and thoughts we hide even from ourselves. A doctor named Freud thought that by understanding our dreams, we could understand these hidden feelings and why they cause problems. 

But another idea was different. It said dreams are just what happens when your brain sorts out memories and things that happened during the day. It’s like your brain is busy tidying up! When you wake up, you try to make a story from the strange pictures and feelings you had while dreaming.

About 200 to 300 years ago, two main ideas about dreams became popular. One idea was that dreams show us things we don’t know about ourselves – feelings and thoughts we don’t realise we have.

","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for A2 level. Successfully simplifies complex concepts like ""conscious mind"" to ""hidden feelings and problems."" The structure is clear and easy to follow.

Weaknesses: Loses some important details from the original text, such as the specific mention of organizing memories and the process of making sense of random images. The explanation of the second theory is oversimplified and doesn't capture the brain's memory organization function.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains good A2-level vocabulary while preserving more detail from the original. The analogy ""like your brain is busy tidying up"" effectively explains the memory organization concept. Successfully explains both theories with appropriate detail for the level.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""things we don't fully know about ourselves – feelings and thoughts we hide even from ourselves"" may be slightly complex for A2 level. Some sentences are longer than typical A2 recommendations.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very accessible language and maintains the key concepts from both theories. The time reference ""200 to 300 years ago"" is more concrete than century numbers. Includes the important detail about random images and the story-making process.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""feelings and thoughts we don't realise we have"" could be challenging for A2 learners. The explanation becomes somewhat repetitive with ""pictures and feelings"" mentioned multiple times.

**Ranking Assessment:**
Model 2 provides the most complete and accurate translation while maintaining A2 accessibility. Model 3 follows closely with good simplification but has some repetitive elements. Model 1, while very simple, loses too much essential content from the original text.

Huge quantities end up being thrown away, and a lot of clothes that charities can't sell are sent abroad, causing even more economic and environmental problems.",gemma-3-27b-it,"

Many people think they are helping by giving old clothes to charity shops. But charity shops receive too many clothes and can’t sell them all. ‘Fast fashion’ clothes are often quickly out of style and not good quality, so people don’t want to buy them used. A lot of these clothes are thrown away. Some are sent to other countries, which causes problems for their economies and the environment.

Many people don’t know they are part of the problem with clothes we throw away, even if they give their old clothes to charity. But charity shops can’t sell all the clothes people give them. ‘Fast fashion’ means clothes become old-fashioned very quickly, and are often not made well, so they can’t be used again. People don’t want to buy these clothes when they’ve been used before. Lots of clothes end up being thrown in the bin, and a lot that charities can’t sell are sent to other countries. This causes problems for those countries’ economies and the environment. 

**Fast fashion:** Clothes that are made and sold quickly and cheaply, following the latest trends.



","
Many people don’t know they are part of the problem with clothes being thrown away, even when they give their old clothes to charity. But charity shops can’t sell all the clothes people give them. ‘Fast fashion’ means clothes are quickly made, become unpopular quickly, and are often not good quality enough to make into something new. People don’t want to buy these clothes even when they are second-hand. So, a lot of clothes are thrown away.

Strengths: Includes ""big cities"" which preserves the original meaning about urban homelessness. Uses ""wants to make"" which maintains the intentional aspect of the artist's work. Vocabulary remains A2-appropriate.
Weaknesses: Changes ""tries to"" to ""wants to make,"" which shifts from describing ongoing effort to describing desire/intention.

Strengths: Provides helpful explanations like ""(archaeologists)"" and ""a language called Latin"" which aids A2 comprehension. Uses very simple vocabulary throughout. Changes ""magic spells"" to ""spells people believed in"" which is more accessible. The phrase ""people who study old things"" effectively explains archaeologists.

Weaknesses: The repetitive use of ""A very long time ago"" and ""old places"" creates somewhat awkward phrasing. The explanation for archaeologists, while helpful, makes the sentence longer and more complex.

DART is a test to see if we can change the path of an asteroid. Scientists will try to hit a small asteroid called Didymoon, which is 150 metres wide. Didymoon goes around a bigger asteroid, which is 800 metres wide. They hope the impact will move Didymoon slightly, so telescopes on Earth can see the change.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for A2 level. Clearly explains the basic concept and includes all key measurements.
Weaknesses: Loses the acronym explanation and the specific detail about ""knocking out of orbit."" The phrase ""change the path"" is less precise than the original concept.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains the acronym explanation, uses accessible language, and includes helpful definitions in parentheses. Maintains the key concept of orbital change and telescope observation. The added explanations of ""asteroid"" and ""moon"" support A2 comprehension.
Weaknesses: The phrase ""bigger rock in space"" is somewhat informal. The explanation becomes longer, which may challenge A2 readers.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Keeps the acronym explanation, uses clear and simple language, and maintains the essential information about the mission. The structure is logical and easy to follow.
Weaknesses: Begins awkwardly with ""This is about a test called DART"" rather than introducing DART directly. The opening feels disconnected from the original's flow.

**Comparative Assessment:**
Model 1 provides the most concise version but sacrifices important details. Model 2 offers the most comprehensive explanation with helpful context, though it's longer. Model 3 maintains good balance between clarity and completeness but has a weaker opening.

All models successfully simplify the vocabulary and sentence structure for A2 level. Model 2 stands out for its educational value with the added definitions. Model 3 maintains good fidelity to the original content. Model 1, while clear, omits too much explanatory detail.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for A2 level. Successfully simplifies complex concepts like ""mining accident"" to ""died"" and maintains the basic plot structure.

Weaknesses: Loses important details like District 12, the mining context, and Gale's role in hunting. The phrase ""dangerous event"" is vague and doesn't convey the significance of the tribute selection. ""Become close"" misrepresents the ""complicated relationship"" aspect.

**Model 2 Feedback:**
Strengths: Retains most key details including District 12, the mining accident context, and Gale's role. Uses A2-appropriate vocabulary while maintaining story coherence. Includes a helpful note explaining ""tribute."" Preserves the hunting skills development aspect.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""with help from her friend Gale"" suggests Gale assists with bow skills rather than being a hunting companion. Some sentences are longer and more complex than typical A2 level.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for A2 level. The phrase ""you will remember them better"" clearly conveys the main idea. The structure is straightforward and easy to follow.

Weaknesses: Changes ""you'll be surprised how much you've written down"" to ""how much you remember,"" which shifts the focus from the quantity of writing to memory retention. Loses the specific mention of ""daily life"" and simplifies ""events and feelings"" to just ""life and feelings.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the original meaning about being surprised by ""how much you write."" Uses appropriate A2-level vocabulary while preserving the concept of linking dreams to waking life events and feelings. The phrase ""when you're awake"" effectively contrasts with dream states.

Weaknesses: Uses the contraction ""you'll"" which may be less clear for A2 learners in some contexts. The phrase ""are linked to"" might be slightly more complex than necessary for this level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides the most complete translation, maintaining key elements like ""write down your dreams"" and ""for a week."" Uses clear, simple language throughout. The phrase ""when you are awake"" (instead of contractions) may be clearer for A2 learners. Preserves the connection between dreams and both events and feelings.

Weaknesses: Slightly longer sentences in some parts. Changes ""how much you've written down"" to ""how much you remember,"" similar to Model 1, though it does mention ""write down"" earlier in the sentence.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for A2 level. The core message is clear and understandable.
Weaknesses: Omits the specific detail about steel wheels and steel tracks creating sparks. The phrase ""destroy them"" lacks clarity about the complete destruction mentioned in the original.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes the important detail about steel wheels and steel tracks. Uses appropriate A2 vocabulary while maintaining accuracy. The phrase ""destroy the whole wooden bridge"" effectively conveys complete destruction.
Weaknesses: The sentence ""they caught fire easily"" could be clearer by explicitly stating that wood catches fire easily.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for A2 level. Successfully conveys the main ideas about traveling artists, internet connectivity, and art world recognition. The phrase ""will continue to exist"" effectively captures the original's ""here to stay.""

Weaknesses: Loses some nuance from the original, particularly the concept of ""emerging trends."" The transition between ideas could be smoother, and some details about photo sharing are omitted.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains A2-appropriate language while preserving more of the original's meaning. The phrase ""some things starting to happen now"" effectively translates ""emerging trends.""

Weaknesses: Retains ""It would be a shame,"" which may be too idiomatic for A2 level. Like the others, reduces ""three religions"" to just ""beliefs."" The sentence structure in some parts could be simpler for the target level.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three translations successfully simplify the original text and maintain the essential plot elements. Model 1 uses the simplest language but loses some important details. Model 2 preserves more factual information while maintaining appropriate simplicity. Model 3 balances detail retention with simplification but includes some potentially challenging phrases for A2 learners.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for A2 level. Maintains the core meaning about the boy's potential escape and the horse-related concerns.
Weaknesses: ""Looked north, across the land"" changes the original phrasing unnecessarily. ""Hitting the ground with its feet"" is less precise than describing the horse's hooves. Omits some descriptive elements like the boy being ""bored and rebellious.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains more original details including the boy being ""unhappy and want to cause trouble."" Uses ""stamping its big feet"" which better conveys the horse's action. Maintains the contrast between good riders and inexperienced people with horses.
Weaknesses: ""Went on and on"" is somewhat repetitive. The phrase structure is occasionally awkward, such as ""A teenage boy might be unhappy and want to cause trouble, but he couldn't walk away and escape.""

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes the boy being ""bored and didn't want to listen,"" preserving character details. Uses simple, clear language throughout. Maintains the logical flow about distance, escape possibilities, and horse-riding concerns.
Weaknesses: ""Looked towards the top of the land"" incorrectly translates ""northern end"" - ""top"" suggests elevation rather than direction. ""You could see as far as you could look"" is redundant and unclear compared to the original meaning.

Accurately conveys the brain and body functioning effects with ""make it hard for your brain and body to work properly."" Includes helpful explanation note about ""orphans.""

Weaknesses: The explanation note about orphans suggests the translator recognized this might be too difficult for A2 learners, indicating a potential vocabulary level issue. Slightly longer sentences may challenge some A2 readers.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Clearly identifies ""Mount Everest"" and uses simple sentence structures. Good use of repetition with ""mountains over 8,000 metres high"" for clarity. Maintains the key information about brain and body effects.

Weaknesses: Uses ""popularity"" instead of simpler alternatives like ""success"" or ""fame."" The phrase ""make your brain and body not work well"" contains awkward grammar with the double negative construction. Retains ""orphans"" without explanation, which may be challenging for A2 learners.

Dogs often live in groups. They have learned that people are more likely to give food to small, cute dogs. So, these dogs often ask for food for all the others in the group. Some dogs are very clever – they even use the city trains to travel around! Scientists don’t know how they know when to get off. Maybe they smell their favourite places, or perhaps they learn the names of the stations from the announcements.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""groups"" instead of ""packs,"" ""city trains"" instead of ""metro system""). The sentence structure is clear and accessible. Successfully conveys the main ideas about dogs begging for food and using trains.

Weaknesses: Loses some specificity from the original text. ""Travel around"" is less precise than ""get from one part of their territory to another."" The phrase ""don't usually pay them much attention"" slightly changes the meaning from ""travel largely unnoticed.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains more detail from the original text, including ""underground trains"" and ""travel around their area"" which preserves the territorial concept. Uses ""either way"" which matches the original structure. The explanation of the two theories about how dogs navigate is clear and complete.

Weaknesses: ""Underground trains"" may be less familiar to A2 learners than simpler alternatives. The sentence ""people who travel on the trains are now used to seeing dogs, and the dogs usually go unnoticed"" is somewhat awkward in construction.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses ""metro trains"" which maintains the original terminology while remaining accessible. The sentence structure is consistently simple and clear. ""Pretty dogs"" is a good A2-level synonym for ""cuter dogs."" The final sentence flows naturally.

Weaknesses: ""Have learnt"" maintains the British spelling but could be simplified to ""have learned"" for consistency. Some minor details are simplified, such as reducing ""excellent sense of smell"" to just ""good sense of smell.""

All three models successfully adapt the text to A2 level by simplifying complex sentences, using more common vocabulary, and maintaining the core information about pack behavior and metro usage.

Weaknesses: Omits important details like ""North America"" (only mentions ""other zoos""), loses the word ""ship"" in favor of ""boat"" which changes the scale, and doesn't specify that Pi ""finds himself"" in the lifeboat - just says he ""finds a small boat."" The phrase ""all die"" is less precise than ""drown.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes helpful explanations for animal names in parentheses, which aids A2 comprehension. Maintains most key details including the geographic specificity of North America. Uses appropriate A2 vocabulary and sentence length. Preserves the meaning of ""ship sinks"" with ""ship goes down into the sea.""
Weaknesses: The animal explanations, while helpful, add length that may not be necessary for A2 level. Some phrases like ""goes down into the sea"" are slightly more complex than needed.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains clear, simple sentence structures suitable for A2 level. Preserves important details like the North America reference and the ship context. Uses straightforward vocabulary throughout.
Weaknesses: Does not provide any support for potentially unfamiliar animal names that A2 learners might not know. The text assumes knowledge of what a hyena and orangutan are without explanation.

All three models successfully simplify the original text's complex sentence structures and maintain the essential plot elements. Model 2 provides the most comprehensive support for A2 learners through its explanatory additions, while Model 3 offers the cleanest simplification. Model 1 loses some important contextual details.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""very popular,"" ""came out,"" ""famous film""). Maintains all key information from the original text. The exclamation marks help convey enthusiasm appropriately.

Weaknesses: ""Online"" is less precise than ""electronic copies"" - it could imply internet sales rather than digital format. The sentence structure, while simple, could be slightly more varied.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful clarification by explaining ""North America"" means ""United States and Canada."" Uses A2-appropriate vocabulary like ""changed into"" for ""translated."" Explains ""computers and tablets"" instead of ""electronic copies,"" making it more concrete for learners.

Weaknesses: The added explanation in parentheses, while helpful, makes the text longer and may not be necessary for A2 level. Some sentences are quite long for this level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Breaks down complex sentences into shorter, simpler ones (""It is written by Suzanne Collins, an American author""). Uses ""changed into"" for ""translated,"" which is A2-appropriate. Explains electronic copies as ""computers and tablets.""

Weaknesses: Uses passive voice (""many millions of copies have been sold"") which is more complex than active voice typically preferred at A2 level. The sentence structure becomes somewhat repetitive with multiple short sentences.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three models successfully simplify vocabulary and maintain factual accuracy. Model 1 keeps the text most concise while preserving all information. Model 2 adds useful context but becomes wordier. Model 3 breaks sentences down well but introduces more complex grammar structures.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and sentence structures appropriate for A2 level. Successfully simplifies complex concepts like ""self-disclosure"" to ""sharing what you think and feel."" Maintains the core message about the importance of deep connections.

Weaknesses: Omits the specific term ""self-disclosure"" entirely, which removes some precision from the original. The phrase ""sharing what you think and feel"" is somewhat redundant.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very accessible language with phrases like ""feeling good"" and ""what's inside."" Maintains good flow and readability. Successfully conveys the distinction between superficial and deep relationships.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""sharing what's inside"" is less precise than the original concept. Completely removes the term ""self-disclosure"" without explanation. Some word choices like ""Being close to people"" slightly alter the original meaning.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for A2 level. The phrase ""feel strange"" effectively conveys the eerie atmosphere. Grammar is consistently correct and accessible.

Weaknesses: Loses some nuance from the original text. The phrase ""it's easy for a film to show"" changes the meaning - the original discusses believability for audiences, not ease for filmmakers. Some simplification removes important details.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the original meaning more accurately, particularly the concept of believability for audiences. Uses italics for emphasis on ""did"" which helps convey the temporal contrast. Vocabulary remains A2-appropriate while preserving key ideas.

Weaknesses: Slightly more complex sentence structures that may challenge some A2 learners. The explanation about phone signals could be clearer for this level.

Strengths: Uses very simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for A2 level. Successfully conveys the main story elements and maintains chronological order. The contrast between human and computer identification is clear.

Weaknesses: Loses some precision from the original - changes ""off-duty"" to ""on holiday"" and ""eyes alone"" becomes just general recognition. The phrase ""knew some people in the videos"" is slightly inaccurate as he recognized them from TV footage of the riots, not from videos generally.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Accurately translates ""off-duty"" and maintains most key details from the original. Correctly explains CCTV as ""security cameras"" and preserves the 200,000 hours detail. The sentence structure remains accessible for A2 learners.

Weaknesses: Changes ""eyes alone"" to ""recognising their faces,"" which alters a key detail about Collins' exceptional identification skills. The phrase ""often just by recognising their faces"" is somewhat redundant since facial recognition is expected in identification tasks.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Correctly translates ""off-duty"" and maintains clear, simple language. Preserves the timeline and main narrative structure. Uses appropriate A2-level vocabulary throughout.

Weaknesses: Significantly alters the meaning by stating he ""knew some of the people causing trouble,"" which implies prior personal knowledge rather than recognition ability. Changes ""eyes alone"" to general face recognition, losing the specific detail about Collins' remarkable skill.

","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level. The sentence structure is clear and accessible. Successfully conveys the main ideas about technology improving human abilities.
Weaknesses: Loses the concept of ""evolution as a species"" entirely, replacing it with the vague ""improve ourselves."" The phrase ""More and more people are starting to think this is a good idea"" changes the meaning from the original's ""commonplace"" (becoming normal/widespread) to people having positive opinions about it.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains simple A2-level vocabulary while preserving more of the original meaning. The phrase ""change as people"" better captures the human development aspect than Model 1. Includes a helpful explanation note for ""augmenting."" Uses italics to emphasize ""inside"" which aids comprehension.
Weaknesses: The ending ""More and more people are starting to think this could happen"" shifts focus to possibility rather than the original's emphasis on increasing acceptance/normalization. The explanation note, while helpful, may not be necessary at A2 level since the concept is explained in context.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses appropriate A2 vocabulary and clear sentence structure. The phrase ""help our bodies change and improve faster"" captures both the enhancement and acceleration aspects from the original. Maintains the practical tone about mathematical ability, perception, and memory.
Weaknesses: Like Model 1, ends with ""think this is a good idea"" rather than conveying the original meaning about something becoming commonplace. Doesn't fully capture the species evolution concept, though ""bodies change and improve faster"" comes closer than the other models.

She also made a valid point about people wanting to be in two or several places at once. So they switch back and forth between their real-life and online conversations.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and sentence structures appropriate for A2 level. Successfully simplifies complex phrases like ""hit the nail on the head"" to ""made some good points."" Clear and accessible language throughout.
Weaknesses: Loses some specificity from the original text. Changes ""waiting at a red light"" to ""driving,"" which alters the meaning slightly. The phrase ""looks at their phones and chats"" is less precise than the original concept of engaging in different conversations.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains more of the original meaning and context. Preserves specific details like ""stopped at a traffic light"" and ""making dinner."" Keeps the personal observation aspect with ""I see this all the time."" Uses appropriate A2-level vocabulary while retaining nuance.
Weaknesses: Retains the idiom ""spot on"" which may be challenging for A2 learners. Some sentences are slightly longer and more complex than typical A2 level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains good balance between simplification and meaning preservation. Uses clear, simple language while keeping important details like ""stop at a red light"" and ""making dinner."" The phrase ""said something important"" effectively replaces ""made a valid point.""
Weaknesses: The sentence ""So, they keep changing between talking to people in real life and talking to people online"" uses ""changing between"" which is less natural than ""switching between."" Minor awkwardness in phrasing compared to other versions.

All three models successfully avoid the original idiom ""hit the nail on the head"" and maintain the core message about parental influence and multitasking behavior.

103-a2,"In an attempt to inject some positivity into their feedback, many managers rely on sandwiching negative feedback between two positive comments. However, when feedback becomes such a routine, employees can start to perceive positive feedback as simply a form of sugarcoating the negatives, thus diminishing its value. Instead, positive feedback should not simply be seen as something to cushion the negative, but should be delivered so as to reinforce and encourage good performance.",gemma-3-27b-it,"

Some managers try to make feedback easier to hear by starting and ending with positive comments around any criticism – like a sandwich. But if this happens often, people may think the positive comments aren’t sincere and don’t mean much. It’s better to give positive feedback to really show someone what they’re doing well and encourage them to keep it up, not just to soften bad news.



","Many managers try to make giving criticism easier by starting and ending with nice things to say. But if this happens all the time, people might think the nice things aren’t real – they might think you’re just trying to make the criticism sound better.

Born in the USA is a lively rock album with songs you can easily enjoy. But the lyrics are also full of feeling. The songs tell stories about the difficulties people face in America. They’re about ordinary people who work hard but don’t always find happiness or success.

For example, “Glory Days” is about people remembering their youth, and “Downbound Train” is about a man whose life gets worse when he loses his job. You can feel the artist is singing about people he knew and imagining his own life. This album shows how talented the singer, known as ‘The Boss’, really is.

Born in the USA is a lively rock album that makes you want to move. But the songs also have a lot of feeling. Even though the music is upbeat, the lyrics tell stories about difficult times in America.

Many songs are about normal people who work hard but still struggle. They feel upset and angry because life isn’t easy and they don’t become rich or famous. For example, “Glory Days” is about people remembering when they were young and felt like anything was possible. “Downbound Train” is about a young man whose life goes wrong when he loses his job. 

You can easily tell the singer is writing about people he knew and thinking about how his own life could have been different. This album really shows how special and talented Bruce Springsteen – known as ‘The Boss’ – is.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level. The sentence structure is clear and accessible. Successfully conveys the main ideas about brain differences, lack of evidence, and the 100,000-year timeline.

Weaknesses: Changes ""artefacts"" to ""old tools"" which narrows the meaning and loses some accuracy. The phrase ""bones of early humans"" is imprecise since the original refers specifically to mouth, throat, and tongue development, not general bones. Omits the concept of evolutionary biologists entirely.

**Model 2 Feedback:**

Strengths: Maintains good vocabulary level for A2. Preserves more of the original meaning by mentioning ""tools and bones"" rather than just tools. Includes the term ""evolutionary biologists"" with explanation in parentheses, which helps learners understand the concept. Uses italics effectively for emphasis.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""tools and bones don't tell us what kind of sounds our ancestors could make"" creates some confusion since bones actually do provide this information according to the text. The explanation maintains most key concepts accurately.

**Model 3 Feedback:**

Strengths: Provides the most complete translation of the original content. Accurately conveys that artifacts don't reveal speech capabilities while remains do show anatomical changes. Maintains the logical flow of the original argument. Uses appropriate A2-level vocabulary throughout.

Weaknesses: Slightly longer sentences in some places may challenge A2 readers. The phrase ""people who lived long ago"" is somewhat wordy compared to ""ancestors,"" though it remains clear.

116-a2,"It is society, not nature, that tells us girls should favour arts and humanities and leave maths and physics to the boys. Coupled with this is the lack of positive female role models youngsters see doing science-related jobs. Cartoons and stories often show the crazy scientist, genius inventor, or adventurous astronaut as a man. Furthermore, there is an unfortunate perception that scientists are geeky, have poor social skills or that their work is lonely and detached from the rest of the world. These are false stereotypes portrayed by the media, but they may mean that girls do not identify with scientists, and see science as an unappealing career path. If girls saw more positive female role models in science it would give them more confidence and a greater sense of belonging in those subjects.",gemma-3-27b-it,"
People, not nature, teach girls to like subjects like art and literature, and think boys are better at maths and science. Also, girls don't often see women working in science. In films and books, scientists are usually men. Some people think scientists are strange and don’t have many friends, or that their job is isolating. This isn’t true, but it can make girls think science isn’t for them. If girls had more female scientists to look up to, they would feel more confident and want to study these subjects.

It’s not natural for girls to prefer subjects like art and literature – society teaches them to. People often think boys are better at subjects like maths and science. Also, young people don’t often see women working in science jobs. 

Often, in cartoons and stories, scientists, inventors, and astronauts are shown as men. Also, some people unfortunately think scientists are strange, not very good with people, or work alone. These ideas aren’t true, and the media often shows them this way. But these ideas might make girls think science isn’t for them, and they might not want to be scientists.

If girls had more examples of successful women in science, they would feel more confident and like they belong in those subjects. 

**(Role models are people who show others what’s possible. Stereotypes are simple ideas about groups of people that aren’t always true.)**

","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for A2 level. Successfully conveys the main message about societal influence and lack of female role models. The phrase ""look up to"" is accessible and natural.

Weaknesses: Loses some important details from the original, such as the specific mention of cartoons/stories and the media's role in perpetuating stereotypes. The connection between stereotypes and media influence is not clearly established.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains good structure with clear paragraphs. Preserves most key concepts from the original including cartoons/stories and media influence. Includes helpful definitions of ""role models"" and ""stereotypes"" which aids A2 comprehension. Uses appropriate vocabulary level throughout.

Weaknesses: Slightly longer and more complex than typical A2 texts. Some sentences could be simplified further. The explanatory notes at the end, while helpful, may not be necessary for the main text.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for A2 level. Maintains logical flow and covers all main points from the original. Good balance between simplification and content retention. Sentence structure is consistently accessible.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""they might not feel they fit in"" could be clearer. Some repetition with ""Also"" at the beginning of paragraphs. Minor loss of emphasis on the ""false stereotypes"" concept.

All three models successfully adapt the content for A2 level by using simpler vocabulary, shorter sentences, and more direct language. They each preserve the core message about societal influence on gender preferences in academic subjects and the importance of female role models in science.

This report is to find out why our workers are leaving. We want to understand what makes our workers happy at work. Then, we will suggest ways to make things better so more workers will stay with us. 

**Employee turnover** means the number of workers who leave a company each year.
**Employee engagement** means how happy and interested workers are in their jobs.
**Employee retention** means keeping workers at the company.



","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses clear, simple language appropriate for A2 level. The numerical explanation ""12 out of 100"" effectively simplifies the percentage concept. Maintains the core message concisely.

Weaknesses: Omits the acknowledgment that 12% ""might not seem high at first glance,"" which is important context from the original. Does not explain key business terms that A2 learners might not know.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Preserves the original's acknowledgment that the rate ""might not sound like a lot."" Uses accessible language while maintaining the complete meaning. Includes helpful definitions of technical terms in a footnote format.

Weaknesses: The footnote format may be less integrated than inline explanations. Uses ""workers"" and ""employees"" interchangeably, which could potentially confuse A2 learners.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains all key information from the original text. Provides clear, integrated definitions of technical terms using bold formatting. Uses consistent vocabulary throughout. Explains the investigation purpose clearly with ""find out why"" and ""understand what makes workers happy.""

Weaknesses: Slightly longer than the other versions, which may be less ideal for A2 level. The bold formatting, while helpful, creates more visual complexity.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three models successfully simplify the percentage concept and use appropriate A2-level vocabulary. Model 1 is the most concise but lacks important context and definitions. Model 2 balances completeness with simplicity and includes necessary definitions. Model 3 provides the most comprehensive explanation with well-integrated term definitions, though it is slightly more complex in presentation.

I don't think this is such an issue for my generation who've lived without technology for so long. We know how to be alone and, more importantly, we know that it's OK to be alone. But the under 20s are another kettle of fish. They're so busy communicating that they never experience the feeling of solitude and run the risk of not learning how to enjoy their own company. In addition, they're learning conversation through messages that can be edited and changed at the expense of learning the art of real conversation in real time with the person in front of you.",gemma-3-27b-it,"What the speaker said made a lot of sense. I think it’s possible to feel lonely even when you’re always in touch with people. My generation grew up without much technology, so we’re used to being alone and we know that’s okay. But young people today are always communicating. They don’t often spend time by themselves, and they might not learn to enjoy being alone.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for A2 level. Successfully conveys the main ideas about generational differences and technology's impact. The phrase ""practice talking by writing messages"" effectively simplifies the original concept.

Weaknesses: Loses the idiomatic expression ""another kettle of fish"" without replacement. The phrase ""made a lot of sense"" is slightly less precise than ""rang true."" Some nuance about the ""art of real conversation"" is simplified to just ""talking to people face-to-face.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains good A2-level vocabulary while preserving more of the original meaning. Successfully explains the contrast between digital and face-to-face communication. The phrase ""felt very true"" captures the original sentiment well. Clearly explains the editing aspect of digital messages.

Weaknesses: The sentence ""They're always talking to people, so they don't often feel alone"" creates some logical confusion - the original suggests they avoid solitude, not that they don't feel alone. Some sentences are longer and more complex than typical A2 level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very clear, simple language appropriate for A2 learners. Breaks down complex ideas into shorter sentences. The final explanation about face-to-face conversation requiring quick thinking is well-developed and clear. Good use of contrast between message editing and real-time conversation.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""when we are always in touch with people, we can also feel lonely"" doesn't clearly convey the paradox from the original. Some repetitive phrasing. The connection between being ""always talking"" and not feeling alone creates similar logical issues as Model 2.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three translations successfully adapt the text to A2 level vocabulary and grammar. Model 1 is the most concise but loses some meaning. Model 2 preserves more original nuance but has some clarity issues. Model 3 provides the clearest explanations and best pedagogical structure for A2 learners, despite some minor logical inconsistencies.
