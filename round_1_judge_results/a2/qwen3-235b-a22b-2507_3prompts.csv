Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level. ""Reveal"" is well-chosen and accessible. The sentence structure is clear and concise. Successfully maintains the core meaning while simplifying complex phrases.

Weaknesses: Loses the nuance of ""insights into things"" by reducing it to just ""thoughts."" The phrase ""being undressed in public"" is slightly more formal than necessary for A2 level.

**Model 2 Feedback:**
Strengths: Maintains the original's tentative tone with ""might."" Uses very accessible vocabulary throughout. ""Being in public without clothes"" is clearer than Model 1's phrasing. Preserves the contrast indicated by ""But"" from the original text.

Weaknesses: The sentence structure closely mirrors the original, which may be slightly complex for A2 learners. Could have simplified the opening concept further.

**Model 3 Feedback:**
Strengths: Keeps the original phrasing ""things you didn't know you were thinking about"" which maintains semantic accuracy. Adds ""are common"" to clarify the nature of these dreams. The final phrase ""how you feel every day"" makes the connection to daily life more explicit.

Weaknesses: The sentence ""Many people have similar meanings for these dreams"" is awkwardly constructed and unclear. The overall text is longer and more complex than necessary for A2 level. Some sentences could be simplified further.

Strengths: Uses simpler vocabulary (""examples"" instead of ""cases,"" ""groups"" instead of ""packs"") and maintains clear sentence structure. The phrase ""left"" is more accessible than ""abandoned.""
Weaknesses: Changes ""in a city"" to ""in cities"" which alters the specific focus. Loses the clarification ""with people"" in the street-crossing behavior, making it less precise.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the singular ""a city"" focus. Uses accessible vocabulary and includes the contraction ""it's"" which is natural for A2 learners. Preserves the meaning about crossing streets with people.
Weaknesses: The phrase ""pets that people left behind"" is slightly awkward compared to other versions. Uses ""there"" which adds an unnecessary word.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful clarification by explaining ""groups called packs"" which aids A2 comprehension. Expands ""cross the street with people"" to ""cross the street when people are crossing"" for better clarity. Uses ""these dogs"" for better cohesion.
Weaknesses: Slightly longer and more complex due to additional explanatory phrases. Retains ""packs"" initially before explaining it, which could momentarily confuse A2 learners.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three models successfully simplify vocabulary and maintain factual accuracy. Model 1 has the most concise approach but loses some precision. Model 2 maintains good balance between simplicity and accuracy. Model 3 provides the most comprehensive clarification for A2 learners despite being slightly longer.

Many people, including me, are excited to see what RJ Palacio will write next.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""facial differences"" instead of ""deformities,"" ""excited"" instead of ""eagerly""). Maintains clear sentence structure and preserves all key information from the original.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""She is from New York"" creates an awkward separation that wasn't in the original. ""New Yorker RJ Palacio"" was simplified but lost some fluency in the process.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Flows more naturally with ""who lives in New York"" integrated into the sentence. Uses A2-appropriate vocabulary like ""face that looked different"" and ""sold very well."" Adds helpful clarification with ""movie based on the book.""

Weaknesses: Changes ""bestseller"" to ""sold very well,"" which loses some precision. The phrase ""one day"" placement is slightly awkward.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains natural flow similar to Model 2. Uses appropriate A2 vocabulary and sentence structures. Preserves the meaning of ""starting point for discussions"" with ""start talks about."" Includes the helpful clarification ""movie based on the book.""

Weaknesses: Minor awkwardness with ""one day"" placement. Changes the verb tense in the final sentence from ""writes"" to ""will write,"" which alters the original meaning slightly.

**Comparison:**
All three models successfully simplify vocabulary and sentence structure for A2 level. Model 1 has the most awkward phrasing with the New York reference. Models 2 and 3 are very similar, with Model 3 having a slight edge in maintaining the original meaning of ""starting point"" with ""start talks about"" rather than just ""talk about."" However, Model 3's tense change in the final sentence is a notable deviation from the original.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for A2 level. Maintains the core narrative flow and key information. The sentence structure is straightforward and accessible.
Weaknesses: Loses some specific details from the original, such as the phrase ""lost count of the times"" and ""patiently tried to explain."" The phrase ""fantastic pets"" is simplified to ""great pets"" but loses some emphasis.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains more detail from the original text, including ""lost count of how many times"" which preserves the original meaning. Maintains good narrative flow while using A2-appropriate vocabulary. Includes the clarification ""for herself"" at the end.
Weaknesses: Slightly longer sentences that may be more challenging for A2 learners. Some phrases like ""that changed her mind"" add interpretation not explicitly in the original.

Strengths: Uses very simple vocabulary and sentence structures suitable for A2 level. Breaks complex ideas into shorter, more digestible sentences. Replaces ""lost count"" with the clearer ""can't remember.""
Weaknesses: Changes ""react badly"" to ""feel afraid or uncomfortable,"" which alters the original meaning and adds interpretation. Loses the nuance of people's general negative reactions to focus specifically on fear and discomfort.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains the playful context with ""while playing,"" which preserves an important detail from the original. Uses accessible language while maintaining accuracy. The phrase ""at risk of disappearing"" effectively explains ""endangered"" for A2 learners.
Weaknesses: The contraction ""it's"" may be less formal than expected. Some vocabulary choices like ""chasing them away"" could be slightly more complex than necessary for the context.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides clear explanation of ""endangered species"" with the added clause ""which means there are not many left in the wild,"" which is helpful for A2 learners. Maintains good structure and includes most original details. Uses ""scare them away"" which is appropriate A2 vocabulary.
Weaknesses: Slightly longer than necessary for A2 level. The phrase ""These workers make sure baboons do not stay in city areas"" is somewhat awkward and doesn't capture the active nature of chasing/catching from the original.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and sentence structures appropriate for A2 level. Successfully simplifies ""bombard"" to ""show"" and ""disposable items"" to simpler language. Maintains the core message clearly.

Weaknesses: Loses some specificity by omitting ""two or three times"" detail. ""British consumers"" becomes ""British shoppers"" which changes the term slightly. The connection between cheap prices and disposable behavior could be clearer.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains the specific ""two or three times"" detail from the original. Uses appropriate A2 vocabulary while maintaining accuracy. The phrase ""In the UK"" is more accessible than ""British consumers."" Clearly explains the cause-and-effect relationship between cheap prices and throwaway behavior.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""things you use once and throw away"" followed by ""two or three times"" creates a minor contradiction. Slightly longer sentences than typical A2 level.

Strengths: Maintains good narrative flow and preserves most key details. Uses appropriate A2-level vocabulary like ""swished,"" ""bothered,"" and ""suited."" The metaphor about shirt patches is simplified effectively to ""countries on a map."" Sentence structure is clear and accessible.

Weaknesses: Loses the specific detail ""against the sun"" which affects the imagery. ""The safer his job"" changes the meaning slightly from the original concept of job duration.

Strengths: Retains important details like ""back of his neck"" and ""ten months."" Good sentence restructuring that maintains clarity. The explanation of the indoor tan is well-developed and clear for A2 readers. Uses simple, appropriate vocabulary throughout.

Weaknesses: Changes ""Big House"" to lowercase ""big house,"" losing the proper noun significance. Adds ""to the stables"" which wasn't in the original text. Some sentences become longer and more complex than typical A2 level.

Strengths: Keeps the sun-related imagery with ""looked hard into the sun."" Maintains the ten-month timeframe and explains the indoor/outdoor work contrast clearly. Uses very simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level.

Weaknesses: ""Looked hard into the sun"" doesn't capture the meaning of ""squinted against."" Changes ""out here"" to ""to the farm,"" adding specificity not in the original. ""Scare away flies"" is more explicit than the original action. The final explanation becomes somewhat repetitive.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""has been destroyed"" uses present perfect tense which may be challenging for A2 learners. Some sentences could benefit from more explicit connections between ideas.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful clarification by explaining that districts are ""areas"" and the Capitol is a ""central city."" Uses very accessible vocabulary throughout.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""bold,"" ""dangerous,"" ""trash bins""). The sentence structure is clear and straightforward. Successfully conveys the main ideas about baboons entering urban areas.

Weaknesses: Changes ""residential areas"" to just ""homes,"" which loses some meaning since baboons don't only enter homes but also the broader residential neighborhoods. Omits ""orchards"" entirely. The phrase ""not happy to see them"" is somewhat vague compared to the original's ""don't welcome their presence.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains most key information while using A2-appropriate vocabulary. ""Stolen"" effectively conveys the baboons' behavior. Includes both homes and gardens, better representing the residential areas concept. Uses simple sentence structures throughout.

Weaknesses: Replaces ""orchards"" with just ""trees,"" losing the specific agricultural context. Changes ""attacked"" to ""hurt,"" which is less precise about the nature of the baboons' aggression toward pets.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains the most complete information from the original text. Specifies ""fruit trees"" instead of just ""trees,"" maintaining more of the orchard concept. Keeps ""attacked"" for accuracy about the baboons' behavior toward pets. The phrase ""it's not surprising"" effectively translates ""understandably"" while remaining accessible.

Weaknesses: Uses ""refrigerators"" alongside ""fridges,"" which creates unnecessary repetition. The final sentence is slightly longer and more complex than typical A2 level, though still comprehensible.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""being built,"" ""mistakes,"" ""wrong calculations""). The sentence structure is clear and concise. ""On site"" is a common workplace term that A2 learners would encounter.

Weaknesses: ""On site"" is less specific than the original's ""on it at the time,"" losing some precision about where the workers are located during the collapse.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains simple vocabulary while preserving the temporal aspect with ""at the time."" Uses ""falls down"" which is more basic than ""collapses."" The phrase ""then falls down"" creates a clear cause-and-effect sequence.

Weaknesses: The word ""then"" adds a sequential element not present in the original. ""Kill"" is more direct but potentially less nuanced than ""deadly.""

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very basic vocabulary (""fall down"" instead of ""collapse""). Maintains the temporal reference with ""at that time."" The phrase ""who are on it"" clearly identifies the workers' location.

Weaknesses: ""Can fall down because of its own weight"" changes the meaning slightly - the original indicates the bridge does collapse, not just that it can collapse. The phrasing is somewhat more awkward with ""who are on it at that time.""

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""dangerous asteroid,"" ""destroy,"" ""push it off course""). Maintains clear sentence structure and preserves the main ideas effectively. The transition between concepts flows naturally.

Weaknesses: Does not explain what ""PHA"" means, which could confuse A2 learners encountering this acronym. Does not provide the full form of ""HAMMER,"" missing an opportunity to help learners understand the acronym.

**Model 2 Feedback:**

Strengths: Explains technical terms clearly by defining ""PHA"" as ""big space rock"" and provides the complete expansion of ""HAMMER."" Uses consistent terminology throughout (""space rock"" instead of switching between terms). Maintains all key information from the original text.

Weaknesses: The sentence structure becomes somewhat complex in places, particularly the sentence explaining HAMMER's full name, which may challenge A2 readers.

**Model 3 Feedback:**

Strengths: Provides clear explanations of technical terms and breaks down complex information into shorter, more digestible sentences. Uses simple vocabulary and explains the weight measurement clearly. The step-by-step explanation of the process is well-structured for A2 level.

Weaknesses: Changes ""Another suggested defence"" to ""One idea,"" which slightly alters the meaning by removing the sense that this is an additional option among several. The sentence about scientists shooting rockets adds information not present in the original.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for A2 level. Maintains the core meaning while simplifying complex phrases like ""refuses the call"" to ""says no."" The sentence structure is straightforward and accessible.
Weaknesses: Omits the concept of ""crossing the threshold,"" which is a key element in Campbell's theory. The explanation lacks some contextual details that help understanding.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides good contextual explanation by adding ""leave their normal life"" and describing the special world as ""new, dangerous world."" Uses ""wise teacher"" instead of ""mentor,"" which may be more accessible to A2 learners. Includes helpful elaboration about the Death Star being the special world.
Weaknesses: Changes ""mentor"" to ""teacher,"" which alters the specific terminology from Campbell's theory. The text becomes longer, which may challenge A2 readers.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains good contextual explanation similar to Model 2. Clearly identifies the Death Star as the special world ""in Star Wars,"" providing helpful context. Uses accessible vocabulary while preserving key concepts.
Weaknesses: Also changes ""mentor"" to ""teacher,"" losing the original terminology. Minor word order change (""makes friends"" vs ""meet friends"") slightly alters the flow. The added length may be challenging for A2 level.

Strengths: Uses appropriate A2-level vocabulary with clear sentence structures. ""Valuable"" effectively replaces ""asset"" while maintaining meaning. The phrase ""individuals to share things directly"" accurately conveys peer-to-peer sharing. Grammar and syntax are correct throughout.

Weaknesses: ""Second-hand goods"" retains more complex vocabulary that could be simplified further for A2 level. The transition between sentences could be smoother.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Simplifies vocabulary consistently, using ""helpful"" instead of ""valuable/asset"" and ""used items"" instead of ""second-hand goods."" Includes ""groups"" when mentioning social media, maintaining accuracy to the original. The phrase ""share things directly with each other"" clearly explains peer-to-peer interaction.

Weaknesses: ""Very easy"" adds emphasis not present in the original text. The overall structure remains faithful to the source.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""show hidden feelings,"" ""random brain activity""). The sentence structure is clear and accessible. Successfully simplifies ""represent"" to ""show.""

Weaknesses: Omits ""Around"" from the opening, slightly changing the meaning. Loses some specificity by removing ""the things we see in"" dreams. The phrase ""sort memories"" is less precise than the original ""organising memories.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains most of the original meaning while using A2-appropriate vocabulary. Preserves the structure ""the things we see in dreams"" which maintains clarity about what dreams contain. Uses ""sorts out"" which is clearer than just ""sorts."" Includes both ""thoughts and feelings"" which is more comprehensive.

Weaknesses: Slightly longer sentences that approach the upper limit for A2 level. The phrase ""by turning them into"" adds unnecessary complexity compared to simpler alternatives.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses ""stand for"" as a good A2-level replacement for ""represent."" Changes ""images"" to ""pictures"" which is more basic vocabulary. Maintains the essential meaning while simplifying language appropriately.

Weaknesses: ""Stand for"" may be less immediately clear than ""show"" for A2 learners. The overall sentence complexity remains relatively high in some sections.

All three models successfully reduce the text to A2 level while preserving the core meaning. They appropriately simplify complex concepts like Freudian dream theory and neurological processes. Each maintains the contrast between the two theories clearly.

Strengths: Maintains clear, simple language throughout. ""Internet was slow"" is a good simplification of ""Wi-Fi connection wasn't ideal."" Uses appropriate A2 vocabulary consistently.
Weaknesses: ""Getting ready"" loses the specific meaning of ""getting dressed"" from the original. The final sentence is somewhat abbreviated compared to the original's fuller explanation about the office environment.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Preserves ""family members"" from the original text, maintaining accuracy. ""I chose to rent"" adds slight variety to sentence structure. The final sentences expand on the office environment concept, staying closer to the original meaning.
Weaknesses: The last sentence becomes slightly more complex with ""just like in a regular office,"" which may be at the upper limit of A2 complexity.

A lot of the clothes that charities can’t sell are sent to other countries, which creates more problems for the environment and local economies.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""throwaway,"" ""old clothes,"" ""low quality""). Maintains the core message while simplifying complex phrases. The sentence structure is straightforward.
Weaknesses: Loses some nuance by omitting ""unwanted clothes"" distinction. The phrase ""reuse or recycle"" adds a concept not in the original. ""Large amounts end up in the trash"" is less formal than the original tone.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains clear A2-level vocabulary while preserving more of the original meaning. Uses ""As a result"" to show cause-and-effect relationships, which aids comprehension. Keeps the distinction between environmental and economic problems.
Weaknesses: ""Becomes outdated"" might be slightly advanced for A2. The sentence ""Fast fashion becomes outdated quickly and is often too low quality to be reused or recycled"" introduces ""reused,"" which wasn't in the original.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides the most complete adaptation of the original meaning. Uses connecting phrases like ""That's because"" and ""As a result"" to help A2 learners follow the logic. Explains the recycling difficulty more clearly with ""made from low-quality material."" Maintains the distinction between charity donation and the broader problem.
Weaknesses: Slightly longer sentences that may challenge A2 readers. ""Low-quality material"" is more specific than necessary for the level.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three models successfully simplify vocabulary and sentence structure for A2 level. Model 1 provides the most basic simplification but loses some meaning. Model 2 offers a good balance of simplicity and completeness. Model 3 provides the most thorough explanation while remaining accessible, though it's slightly more complex.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Good vocabulary adaptation with ""very hot 45ºC weather"" providing helpful context. Maintains narrative flow while simplifying language. Includes important detail about pulling the sledge ""the whole way.""

Weaknesses: Opens with ""Not happy with just one exciting trip"" which retains some complexity from the original. Still uses ""sledge"" without explanation.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Excellent vocabulary support with explanations like ""45ºC — very hot!"" and ""deep crack in the ice, called a glacier."" Uses ""sled"" instead of ""sledge"" which is more familiar. Breaks complex sentences into shorter, clearer segments. Adds helpful detail about ""storms with strong winds and ice.""

Weaknesses: Slightly longer than necessary for A2 level. The explanation of glacier as ""deep crack in the ice"" is somewhat inaccurate, though understandable for the target level.

**Overall Assessment:**
Model 3 provides the most comprehensive support for A2 learners through vocabulary explanations and familiar terms, despite minor length and accuracy issues. Model 1 offers good simplification but lacks vocabulary support. Model 2 falls between the others with some helpful additions but retains more complex phrasing.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and sentence structures appropriate for A2 level. Maintains the core meaning and includes all key examples (Taiwan graffiti zones, São Paulo subway trains).

Weaknesses: Loses the concept of ""encouragement"" by councils - changes it to simply ""let,"" which alters the original meaning. The phrase ""instead of on random walls"" doesn't fully capture that the goal is to prevent random graffiti while providing alternatives.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Preserves the original meaning more accurately by mentioning councils ""tried to stop random graffiti."" Uses appropriate A2-level vocabulary while maintaining factual accuracy. Includes all key information and examples.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""local governments have tried to stop"" could be slightly complex for A2 learners. Uses ""lets"" which is more informal than the original tone.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides the clearest explanation of the motivation behind the policy (""want artists to stop painting graffiti on walls wherever they want""). Adds helpful clarification (""without getting in trouble"") that aids A2 comprehension. Uses very simple sentence structures and vocabulary.

Weaknesses: Slightly longer than necessary for A2 level. The addition of explanatory text, while helpful, moves away from direct translation. Changes ""councils"" to ""local governments"" and ""city government,"" which may be more accurate but less consistent with the original terminology.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains good A2-level vocabulary while preserving more detail from the original text. Includes the problem-solving aspect that was in the original. The explanation flows logically and uses appropriate transitional phrases.

Weaknesses: Some sentences are longer and more complex, which may challenge A2 learners. The phrase ""share their opinions, even if they disagree"" could be clearer about what they're disagreeing with.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very accessible vocabulary and sentence structures suitable for A2 level. Clearly explains the contrast between the two work cultures. The addition of ""or helpers"" makes the coaching concept more understandable. Explicitly mentions both problem-solving and decision-making.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary consistently (""goes around,"" ""bigger,"" ""a little""). Breaks down the explanation into shorter, more digestible sentences. The final sentence clearly explains the scientists' hopes and expectations.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""change its path a little"" followed by ""this change will be big enough"" creates a logical inconsistency that could confuse learners. Uses ""named"" instead of ""called"" inconsistently with the later use of ""called 'Didymoon'.""

**Overall Assessment:**
All three models successfully simplify the technical content for A2 level. Model 2 provides the most consistent vocabulary simplification while maintaining clarity. Model 1 preserves accuracy well but uses slightly more complex structures. Model 3 has good sentence structure but contains the logical inconsistency about the change being both ""little"" and ""big enough.""

Strengths: Maintains formal vocabulary appropriately simplified for A2 level. Uses clear sentence structures and preserves most original details accurately. The phrase ""take her place"" is clear and direct.

Weaknesses: Retains ""heroine"" which may be too advanced for A2 learners. ""Complicated relationship"" might be challenging vocabulary for this level.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very accessible vocabulary throughout, with ""main character"" instead of ""heroine"" and ""says she will go"" for volunteering. Sentence structures are simple and clear. ""Difficult relationship"" is more A2-appropriate than ""complicated.""

Weaknesses: Changes ""mining accident"" to ""mine accident"" which slightly alters the original meaning. Some simplification may be excessive, potentially losing nuance.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful context by mentioning ""Hunger Games"" explicitly, which aids comprehension. Adds ""mother"" to clarify family composition. Uses accessible vocabulary like ""main character"" and ""little sister.""

Weaknesses: Adds information not present in the original text (""mother,"" ""Hunger Games""). ""Confusing"" adds an interpretation not in the source. The final sentence becomes longer and potentially more complex than necessary for A2.

**Overall Assessment:**
Model 1 stays closest to the original while making appropriate simplifications. Model 2 achieves the best balance of accessibility and accuracy for A2 level. Model 3 adds helpful context but introduces information not in the source text.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for A2 level. Maintains the core meaning while simplifying complex structures. The phrase ""what happens and how you feel in everyday life"" is accessible.
Weaknesses: ""Then"" changes the temporal relationship from the original ""Now."" Some nuance is lost in the simplification.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Effectively breaks down complex ideas into simpler components. Uses ""who was in the dream and where it took place"" which is very clear for A2 learners. Maintains the original's ""Now"" for proper sequencing. The phrase ""what's happening in your life"" uses present continuous appropriately.
Weaknesses: Slightly longer than necessary for A2 level. ""You might be surprised"" is less definitive than the original's certainty.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary throughout. ""Remember more parts of them"" is very accessible. Maintains logical flow with ""Now you can begin."" Uses ""are connected"" which shows clear relationship.
Weaknesses: ""Parts of them"" is less precise than ""details."" ""Begin to see"" is weaker than the original's more direct approach. The phrase structure is sometimes awkward.

All three translations successfully reduce complexity for A2 level learners and maintain the essential meaning. Model 2 provides the clearest explanation of dream elements while preserving the original's structure and tone most effectively. Model 1 offers good simplification but has minor sequencing issues. Model 3, while using simple language, loses some precision and natural flow.

This was especially true for old train bridges. The sparks from the metal train wheels touching the metal tracks could sometimes set the bridge on fire, and it might burn completely.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""burn easily,"" ""metal wheels,"" ""destroy""). The sentence structure is straightforward and easy to follow.
Weaknesses: ""Set the bridge on fire and destroy it"" creates slight redundancy. The translation is somewhat shorter than the original, potentially losing some detail.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains good A2-level vocabulary while preserving more detail from the original text. ""Long ago"" is a clear time reference. The phrase ""burning it down completely"" effectively conveys the complete destruction mentioned in the original.
Weaknesses: ""Rolling on metal tracks"" adds a detail not explicitly in the original text. The sentence structure, while still A2-appropriate, is slightly more complex.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses appropriate A2 vocabulary and maintains the key information from the original. ""Touching the metal tracks"" provides a clear physical description of how sparks are created.
Weaknesses: ""It might burn completely"" is less definitive than the original's ""burn to the ground,"" potentially weakening the impact. The conditional ""might"" changes the tone from the original's more direct statement.

All three translations successfully simplify the vocabulary and sentence structure for A2 level learners. Model 2 provides the most complete information transfer while maintaining appropriate language level. Model 1 offers the simplest structure but sacrifices some detail. Model 3 falls between the others but uses less decisive language than the original text warrants.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and sentence structures appropriate for A2 level. The phrase ""travelling the world to create art"" is clear and accessible. Successfully maintains the original meaning while simplifying complex phrases like ""legitimate art form"" to ""real form of art.""

Weaknesses: The phrase ""what the future holds"" may be slightly idiomatic for A2 learners. Some sentences could be broken down further for better comprehension.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Effectively breaks down complex ideas into simpler language. Uses ""patterns are starting to appear"" which is clearer than the original ""trends are emerging."" The sentence structure varies appropriately while remaining accessible. Good use of ""pictures"" instead of ""photos"" and clear explanation of internet usage.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""one thing is clear"" followed by a colon construction might be slightly advanced for A2 level. The sentence ""Even though we don't know exactly what will happen, one thing is clear: street art isn't going away"" is somewhat long and complex.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains very simple vocabulary throughout. Uses ""we can see some new trends"" which is more concrete than abstract phrasing. The sentence ""we can be sure that street art will not go away"" directly mirrors the original's certainty while using simple language.

Weaknesses: Begins with ""It is hard to say"" which maintains the more formal register of the original rather than fully adapting to A2 conversational style. Some sentences remain relatively long for the target level.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three models successfully reduce vocabulary complexity and maintain the original meaning. Model 2 provides the most natural flow while staying within A2 parameters.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""earn a little extra money,"" ""barely used,"" ""prams""). The sentence structure is clear and straightforward. Successfully conveys the main concept about online platforms enabling easier selling.

Weaknesses: Changes ""used to avoid"" which implies they previously chose not to do it, rather than the original meaning that they ""might not have bothered"" due to inconvenience. Loses some nuance about the decision-making process.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the conditional aspect (""might not have had time"") which better reflects the original meaning. Uses A2-appropriate vocabulary like ""garage sale"" and ""barely used."" Preserves the contrast between past and present situations effectively.

Weaknesses: Uses ""garage sale"" instead of ""car boot sale,"" which changes the cultural reference. The phrase ""had time"" slightly shifts the emphasis from ""bothered"" to time constraints specifically.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains ""car boot sale"" from the original text, maintaining cultural accuracy. Uses simple vocabulary throughout (""earn a little money quickly,"" ""table,"" ""barely wore""). Clearly explains the benefit of getting money back.

Weaknesses: ""Set up a table"" is less precise than ""stall"" or ""stand."" The phrase ""clothes their kids barely wore"" is slightly awkward grammatically. ""Earn a little money quickly"" changes the emphasis from the casual nature (""quick buck"") to speed of earning.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""strong storms,"" ""hot Pacific sun,"" ""very lonely and sad""). The sentence structure is clear and accessible. Successfully maintains the narrative flow while simplifying complex terms.

Weaknesses: Loses some specificity from the original text, such as ""burning heat"" becoming just ""hot"" and ""despair"" being simplified to ""sad."" The phrase ""they see the Mexican coast ahead"" is less precise than the original's ""appears on the horizon.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides additional context by naming the three religions (Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam), which helps A2 readers understand the reference. Maintains more of the original's descriptive language with ""extreme tiredness"" and ""suffer under the hot sun."" Uses ""hopeless"" which is closer to the original's ""despair.""

Weaknesses: Includes more complex vocabulary that may challenge A2 learners (""extreme,"" ""suffer,"" ""hopeless""). The sentence about religions is longer and more complex than typical A2 level text.

NASA says there are about 50 more of these big asteroids to find. But of the 887 they already know about, none will likely hit Earth or cause serious harm.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""found and recorded,"" ""serious threat""). Maintains clear sentence structure and includes all key numerical data (90%, 1km, 50 million km, 50 remaining, 887 total).

Weaknesses: Uses ""travel within"" which could confuse A2 learners about asteroid movement versus orbital proximity. The phrase ""serious threat to Earth"" is less specific than the original's meaning about danger level.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful clarification by explaining ""Earth's path around the Sun"" instead of just ""Earth's orbit."" Uses the dash effectively to add explanatory information. Maintains technical accuracy while simplifying language.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""space rocks as big as mountains that come within"" creates a longer, more complex sentence structure that may challenge A2 readers. The dash construction adds grammatical complexity.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very simple sentence structures with clear breaks. Explains ""Earth's path around the Sun"" for better comprehension. The final sentence clearly explains the safety aspect with ""none will likely hit Earth or cause serious harm.""

Weaknesses: Changes ""significant danger"" to ""likely hit Earth or cause serious harm,"" which adds interpretation not present in the original. Creates choppy reading flow due to overly simplified sentence breaks. Uses ""big asteroids"" instead of maintaining ""large asteroids"" consistency.

**Ranking Assessment:**
Model 1 provides the most accurate translation while maintaining appropriate A2 simplification. Model 2 offers good clarification but increases sentence complexity. Model 3 oversimplifies to the point of changing meaning and creating awkward flow.

Then, something very difficult and sad happens during a school camp trip. This event changes everything.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and sentence structures appropriate for A2 level. Maintains the core narrative flow and key plot points. The phrase ""thinking he might make them sick"" effectively simplifies the plague concept.

Weaknesses: Loses the intensity of the original emotional language. ""Especially hard"" understates ""agonising experience."" The ending feels abrupt and doesn't capture the significance of the camp event.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains the plague reference with clear explanation. Good use of A2-appropriate vocabulary while maintaining narrative coherence. Effectively explains the misconception about contagion.

Weaknesses: Contains some awkward phrasing like ""hard feelings don't stop"" which doesn't accurately convey the ongoing social challenges. The explanation of ""the plague"" interrupts the narrative flow.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Adds emotional clarity with ""It really hurts his feelings."" Provides the most thorough explanation of the plague concept. Uses very simple sentence structures consistently.

Weaknesses: Contains redundant explanations that disrupt reading flow. The parenthetical clarification about the plague being ""not real"" and ""just a mean thing"" is overly explanatory. ""Go on his first day"" is awkward phrasing compared to ""face his first day.""

**Overall Assessment:**
All three models successfully reduce vocabulary complexity and sentence length for A2 level. Model 1 provides the smoothest reading experience but sacrifices some emotional depth. Model 2 balances explanation with narrative flow reasonably well. Model 3 over-explains concepts, making the text feel pedagogical rather than narrative.

Strengths: Maintains the original meaning effectively. Uses appropriate A2-level vocabulary with clear sentence structures. The phrase ""went on and on"" effectively conveys the vastness. Successfully preserves the contrast between skilled and unskilled riders.

Weaknesses: ""Stamping"" may be slightly more complex than necessary for A2 level. The final sentence structure with the dash could be challenging for A2 readers.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains most original details including ""north end"" and ""property/land."" Uses simple, clear vocabulary throughout. The phrase ""hard to spot"" is accessible. Maintains the complete meaning of the final comparison about trouble.

Weaknesses: ""Pawing"" is a more technical term that A2 learners may not know. The sentence ""No matter how bored or angry a teenage boy got"" uses a complex conditional structure that may exceed A2 level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very simple vocabulary with ""hitting the ground"" instead of technical horse movement terms. Clarifies ""ride a horse"" explicitly. Replaces ""anyone"" with ""other people"" which is more concrete for A2 learners. Uses ""he thought"" instead of ""he wondered.""

Weaknesses: ""Far north side"" is slightly awkward phrasing. Loses some nuance by oversimplifying certain expressions. The overall flow is less natural due to the extensive simplification.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three models successfully reduce complexity while maintaining the core narrative. Model 2 preserves the most original details while keeping language accessible. Model 1 maintains good flow but uses some challenging vocabulary. Model 3 prioritizes simplicity but sacrifices some natural expression.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""cold weather"" instead of ""freezing conditions,"" ""top climbers"" instead of ""world's best climbers""). Maintains clear sentence structure and preserves all key information.

Weaknesses: ""After school"" is ambiguous - could mean daily after school rather than after completing education. Omits ""Mount"" before Everest, making it less clear for A2 learners.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes ""Mount Everest"" for clarity. Uses ""Even though"" to show contrast appropriately for A2 level. Clarifies ""when she was a teenager"" instead of just ""as a teenager."" Vocabulary choices like ""tall mountains"" and ""strong storms"" are A2-appropriate.

Weaknesses: ""After school"" remains ambiguous about whether it means after daily school or after finishing education.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes ""Mount Everest"" for clarity. Uses simple sentence structures by breaking complex sentences into shorter ones. ""When she was a teenager"" is clearer than the original phrasing. Adds ""she"" for clarity in the final sentence.

Weaknesses: ""After school"" is still ambiguous. The phrase ""new and harder challenges"" adds interpretation not present in the original text.

**Overall Comparison:**
All three models successfully simplify vocabulary and maintain A2-level language. Models 2 and 3 provide better clarity by including ""Mount"" and expanding ""as a teenager.""

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and sentence structures appropriate for A2 level. Maintains all key information from the original text. The phrase ""little oxygen at high altitudes"" is clear and accessible.

Weaknesses: ""8,000-meter peaks"" retains the more complex compound structure from the original, which may be challenging for A2 learners.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Effectively explains ""8,000-meter peaks"" by rephrasing as ""highest mountains—each over 8,000 metres tall."" Provides a clear scientific explanation with ""the air has less oxygen."" Uses simple sentence structures throughout.

Weaknesses: The dash construction may be slightly complex for A2 level, though it serves a useful explanatory purpose.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Breaks complex information into two separate sentences, making it more digestible for A2 learners. Uses very simple vocabulary and sentence structures. The phrase ""very little oxygen at the top of high mountains"" is concrete and easy to understand.

Weaknesses: Creates slightly more text by splitting sentences, though this aids comprehension rather than hindering it.

**Comparison:**
All three models successfully adapt the text for A2 level while preserving the original meaning. Model 1 maintains the most compact structure but retains one potentially challenging phrase.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and clear sentence structure appropriate for A2 level. Maintains the core meaning while simplifying complex phrases like ""being put to good use"" to ""useful."" The semicolon structure preserves the list format effectively.

Weaknesses: Omits ""at some point in our lives"" and ""we would no doubt notice,"" losing some temporal context and certainty expression. ""Cool"" may be too informal compared to ""trendy.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains more original elements like ""over the years"" and ""tropical,"" providing better context. Uses A2-appropriate vocabulary while maintaining the original's meaning. Includes ""probably"" which captures the original's ""no doubt"" sentiment.

Weaknesses: Still uses semicolons which may be challenging for A2 learners. The sentence remains quite long and complex for the target level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Breaks the complex original sentence into multiple simple sentences, making it much more accessible for A2 learners. Uses clear transitional phrases like ""For example"" and ""Or"" to guide readers. Explains the guest room situation more explicitly, which aids comprehension.

Weaknesses: Changes the sentence structure significantly from the original. The final explanation about the guest room adds information not present in the source text. Uses ""home"" instead of ""house,"" which slightly alters the original word choice.

**Overall Assessment:**
Model 1 provides a faithful but somewhat simplified translation. Model 2 balances fidelity with accessibility but retains complex punctuation. Model 3 prioritizes A2 comprehension through sentence breaking and explicit explanations, though it deviates more from the original structure.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for A2 level. The phrase ""for a long time, in many cultures"" effectively simplifies the original opening. Maintains the core meaning while using accessible vocabulary.

Weaknesses: The dash formatting around the examples creates an awkward pause. ""Seeing it happen"" is less precise than the original concept of the dream ""coming true.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains good A2-level simplicity while preserving the dual concept of ""knowledge or understanding"" from the original. The word order in the examples flows naturally. Uses ""actually happened"" which captures the meaning well.

Weaknesses: The em-dash formatting disrupts the sentence flow. Minor issue with maintaining the temporal sequence from the original.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Best preserves the original structure and meaning while adapting to A2 level. ""Many parts of the world"" effectively translates ""across cultures."" Maintains the phrase ""remember a time when they dreamed"" which closely mirrors the original. ""That dream actually happened"" provides the clearest connection between the dream and reality.

Weaknesses: Slightly more complex sentence structure in some parts, though still within A2 range. The dash formatting issue persists.

Strengths: Uses appropriate A2-level vocabulary replacements like ""whole length"" for ""length,"" ""reached"" for ""arrived,"" and ""stayed safe"" for ""survived."" Maintains good sentence flow and readability.
Weaknesses: Changes the tense from present (""is"") to past (""was"") in the opening sentence, which alters the original meaning. Uses ""after walking"" which maintains a more complex sentence structure.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Preserves the original present tense (""is the first person""), uses simpler vocabulary effectively, and breaks down complex information appropriately. Changes ""of Peru"" to ""in Peru"" for clearer location reference.
Weaknesses: Keeps the longer, more complex sentence structure ""reached the river's end in Brazil two years and four months later. He walked 6,000 kilometres"" which could be challenging for A2 learners.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the original present tense, uses simple A2-appropriate vocabulary, and breaks complex sentences into shorter, more digestible units. The sentence ""Two years and four months later, he reached the river's end in Brazil. He walked 6,000 kilometres"" creates clearer, separate ideas that are easier for A2 learners to process.
Weaknesses: The sentence structure becomes somewhat choppy due to the extensive breaking up of information.

**Ranking Assessment:**
Model 3 provides the most appropriate A2-level adaptation by maintaining original tense, using simple vocabulary, and breaking complex sentences into manageable chunks. Model 2 follows closely with good vocabulary choices and tense preservation but retains more complex sentence structures. Model 1, while readable, changes the original tense and maintains some complexity that may challenge A2 learners.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""realised,"" ""profitable,"" ""connect""). Maintains the core meaning while simplifying complex phrases like ""caught on to the profitability"" to ""realised...can be profitable."" The sentence structure is clear and accessible.

Weaknesses: Omits the middleman concept entirely, which is important for understanding how these platforms work. The explanation is somewhat brief and misses some contextual details that help A2 learners understand the business model.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides the most comprehensive explanation with helpful details like ""travelers who need a place to stay"" and ""give rides to others."" Uses very simple vocabulary (""make money,"" ""business idea,"" ""websites or apps""). Explains the value proposition clearly for A2 learners.

Weaknesses: Slightly longer than typical A2 texts, which might challenge some learners. The phrase ""business idea now"" is somewhat awkward compared to other versions.

Strengths: Maintains technical vocabulary appropriately simplified for A2 level (""genetic diversity,"" ""breeding programmes""). The sentence structure flows naturally while remaining accessible. Successfully preserves the meaning of complex concepts like genetic similarity.

Weaknesses: Some terms like ""genetic diversity"" and ""genetically similar"" might still be challenging for A2 learners. The phrase ""struggle to find mates"" uses vocabulary that could be simplified further.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very simple, concrete language (""have babies"" instead of ""breed,"" ""hurt by hunters"" instead of ""threatened by poachers""). Explains concepts in basic terms that A2 learners can easily understand. The phrase ""dying out"" is more accessible than ""endangered.""

Weaknesses: The explanation becomes somewhat wordy in places. ""Genes"" is introduced without much context, though it's explained simply. Some sentences are longer than ideal for A2 level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very accessible vocabulary (""disappearing,"" ""have babies,"" ""people who hunt them illegally""). Provides clear explanations of threats with simple language. The concept of genetic similarity is explained in understandable terms.

Weaknesses: Contains some unnecessarily complex phrases like ""animals that eat them"" instead of simply ""predators."" The text is longer than the other versions, which may reduce comprehension for A2 learners. Some sentences are quite lengthy for the target level.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""sorts out,"" ""handles""). Maintains clear sentence structure and preserves the main scientific concepts about brain function during sleep.

Weaknesses: ""From the day"" is less natural than ""during the day."" The transition between ideas could be smoother, and it doesn't fully capture the symbolic nature of dreams mentioned in the original.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains more detail from the original text (""we had during the day,"" ""in our heads""). Uses ""feelings"" instead of ""emotions,"" which is more A2-appropriate. Maintains good flow between sentences.

Weaknesses: ""Works less"" is slightly awkward phrasing. The explanation could benefit from more explicit connection between the brain changes and dream characteristics.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Breaks down complex ideas into shorter, clearer sentences. Adds explanatory content (""That's why dreams feel so emotional and strange"") that helps A2 learners understand the connection between the scientific explanation and their experience. Uses very accessible vocabulary throughout.

Weaknesses: The added explanation, while helpful, goes beyond the original text. Some might argue this addition changes the scope of the original content.

**Overall Assessment:**
Model 3 provides the clearest explanation for A2 learners by breaking complex ideas into digestible parts and explicitly connecting cause and effect. Model 2 maintains good fidelity to the original while using appropriate vocabulary. Model 1, while accurate, is the least accessible for the target level.

Strengths: Uses simpler vocabulary (""connections"" instead of ""ties,"" ""deep talks"" instead of ""heart-to-heart""), maintains clear structure, and preserves all key concepts. The sentence structure is appropriately simplified for A2 level.
Weaknesses: The term ""supportive relationships"" may be slightly advanced for A2 level, and ""self-disclosure"" is retained without additional explanation.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains very close adherence to the original text structure while using accessible vocabulary. Successfully preserves the original phrase ""big part of being happy"" and uses simple past tense consistently. The explanation of self-disclosure is clear.
Weaknesses: Retains the technical term ""self-disclosure"" without further simplification, and some sentence structures remain relatively complex for A2 level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides the most comprehensive explanation by adding ""personal feelings"" and ""true thoughts"" to clarify meaning. Uses ""honest connection"" which adds clarity to the concept. Maintains all original ideas while making them more accessible.
Weaknesses: Slightly longer than necessary for A2 level, and the addition of ""honest"" and ""true"" may not be essential simplifications.

**Comparative Assessment:**
All three models successfully maintain the core message and key vocabulary. Model 1 shows the most significant structural simplification. Model 2 stays closest to the original while making appropriate vocabulary adjustments. Model 3 provides the most explanatory approach but may be slightly verbose for the target level.

Each model appropriately handles the technical term ""self-disclosure"" by providing context, though none completely eliminates the term. All maintain appropriate sentence length and complexity for A2 level learners.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for A2 level. Effectively simplifies ""plasticity of the brain"" to ""brains can change and grow."" The phrase ""born organiser"" is a good natural equivalent for the original concept.
Weaknesses: Loses some specificity from the original text. The connection between brain plasticity and skill development could be clearer.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains good A2-level vocabulary while preserving more of the original meaning. The structure flows logically from concept to examples to research findings. Uses appropriate simplifications like ""noticing small things"" for ""eye for details.""
Weaknesses: The phrase ""natural at planning events"" slightly changes the original meaning from ""organising events."" Some sentences could be shorter for A2 level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides the most complete translation of the original content. Maintains the logical flow and includes specific details like ""in the beginning"" and ""for example."" The vocabulary remains accessible while being comprehensive.
Weaknesses: Some sentences are longer and more complex than typical A2 level. The phrase ""what seems like natural talent"" adds complexity that wasn't in the original.

**Comparative Analysis:**
All three models successfully simplify the academic language and maintain the core message about growth mindset and the importance of praising process over results. Model 1 is the most simplified but loses some content. Model 2 strikes a good balance between simplicity and completeness. Model 3 is the most thorough but may be slightly too complex for strict A2 level requirements.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""checks,"" ""regularly,"" ""simple,"" ""does not last long""). Maintains all key information from the original text. The sentence structure is clear and accessible.

Weaknesses: ""Regularly"" might be slightly more advanced than ""from time to time"" for A2 learners. The phrase ""making more of it"" appears twice in quick succession, which could be repetitive.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very accessible A2-level vocabulary throughout. ""From time to time"" is more suitable for A2 than ""regularly."" Simplifies ""organic molecule"" to ""simple chemical,"" which may be easier for A2 learners to understand.

Weaknesses: Loses the scientific precision by changing ""organic molecule"" to ""chemical"" - this removes important factual content. The simplification may be excessive for the intended level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the scientific term ""organic molecule"" while keeping it accessible. Uses appropriate A2 vocabulary (""from time to time,"" ""does not last very long""). Preserves all factual information from the original. The sentence structure is well-adapted for A2 level with shorter, clearer sentences.

Weaknesses: Slightly more complex sentence structure in some parts, but still within A2 range.

Strengths: Maintains clear structure and logical flow. Uses appropriate A2-level vocabulary while preserving key statistical information accurately. Sentence construction is straightforward and accessible.
Weaknesses: The phrase ""generally more peaceful than before"" could be clearer. Some sentences remain relatively complex for A2 level.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses conversational language (""there's reason to feel hopeful"") that suits A2 learners. Breaks down the murder rate statistics into separate sentences for better comprehension. Maintains factual accuracy throughout.
Weaknesses: The phrase ""living in peace more than they did in the past"" is awkward. Some vocabulary choices like ""civilians"" might still challenge A2 learners.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Replaces ""civilians"" with ""ordinary people,"" making it more accessible to A2 learners. Provides clear explanations of statistics by rephrasing ""per 100,000 people"" as ""out of every 100,000."" Uses simpler vocabulary consistently.
Weaknesses: Changes ""political conflict"" to ""wars between countries,"" which slightly alters the original meaning. The opening sentence loses the nuance about news stories specifically.

All three models successfully reduce complexity while maintaining the core message. Model 3 demonstrates the strongest adaptation to A2 level through vocabulary choices and statistical explanations. Model 2 shows good simplification but has some awkward phrasing. Model 1 provides accurate translation but retains more complex elements.

Strengths: Maintains clear sentence structure and preserves most key information. Uses appropriate A2-level vocabulary and sentence length. The phrase ""much more talkative"" effectively conveys the contrast.

Weaknesses: Changes ""good story or two"" to ""great story,"" altering the original tone. Omits ""housing estate"" which is important context. The phrase ""But she only used those skills"" slightly changes the meaning from the original's emphasis on luck.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very accessible vocabulary appropriate for A2 level. Clearly explains the Glasgow context as ""a part of Glasgow with a lot of crime."" Maintains the contrast between past quietness and current visibility. Includes proper formatting with italics for the TV show.

Weaknesses: Changes ""best-selling author"" to ""popular writer,"" losing the commercial success aspect. Omits ""housing estate"" and ""highest crime rate,"" reducing specificity. The phrase ""help write her books"" is awkward and changes the meaning.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains ""highest crime rate"" which preserves important detail from the original. Maintains ""Luckily"" which preserves the original's tone and meaning. Uses clear, simple language while keeping most original information. Includes proper formatting and maintains good flow.

Weaknesses: Uses ""all over the UK"" instead of ""throughout the UK,"" though this is minor. Slightly condenses some information but without significant meaning loss.

**Ranking:** [""Model 3"", ""Model 1"", ""Model 2""]

Model 3 ranks highest for preserving the most accurate meaning and important details while maintaining A2-appropriate language. Model 1 follows for its clear structure despite some omissions. Model 2 ranks lowest due to meaning changes and the awkward ""help write"" phrasing."

Strengths: Maintains clear, simple sentence structures appropriate for A2 level. Successfully simplifies ""demagogues"" to ""leaders and media"" and ""commentators"" is handled well. The core message remains intact.

Weaknesses: ""Tribal feelings"" may be unclear to A2 learners. ""Under threat"" might be slightly advanced. The translation loses some specificity by omitting ""fatalism"" entirely and replacing it with ""fear.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful explanations like ""which help us solve problems"" and adds clarifying context about Enlightenment values. ""Making life better"" is a clear simplification of ""progress."" Includes explanatory phrases that aid comprehension.

Weaknesses: Significantly longer than the original, which contradicts A2 simplification principles. ""Stir up"" and ""tribal thinking"" may be challenging vocabulary. The added explanations, while helpful, make the text more complex overall.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains good flow while simplifying complex concepts. ""Loud voices"" effectively replaces ""commentators and demagogues."" Explains abstract concepts like ""beyond repair"" in context. Preserves the logical structure of the original argument.

Weaknesses: Longest of all versions, adding considerable length. ""Beyond repair"" is advanced vocabulary for A2. Some added phrases like ""loud voices use fear, anger, or distrust to divide people"" introduce complexity not present in simpler alternatives.

**Overall Assessment:**
Model 1 achieves the best balance of simplification while maintaining meaning. Model 2 adds helpful context but becomes too lengthy. Model 3 provides good explanations but is the most verbose and includes some advanced vocabulary.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""heroes,"" ""trouble,"" ""tension""). The sentence structure is clear and direct. Successfully conveys the main concept about horror films and phone problems.

Weaknesses: Loses some specificity from the original text. ""Heroes in trouble"" is less precise than ""protagonists were in desperation."" The phrase ""you can be sure"" is slightly less formal than the original's tone.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains good vocabulary level while preserving more detail from the original (""main characters,"" ""guaranteed""). Keeps the structure close to the source text. Uses appropriate A2-level expressions like ""hard to believe"" and ""right as you're trying to call.""

Weaknesses: ""It's almost guaranteed"" might be slightly complex for A2 level. The text could benefit from more explicit connections between ideas.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Adds helpful explanatory elements like ""That made sense back then"" and ""most people have mobile phones"" which aid A2 comprehension. Uses very accessible vocabulary throughout. The phrase ""Easy: no phone signal!"" makes the explanation clearer for learners.

Weaknesses: Adds information not present in the original text (""That made sense back then,"" ""most people have mobile phones""). The addition ""or both happen at once"" is redundant since ""or both"" already conveys this meaning.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three translations successfully reduce complexity for A2 learners. Model 1 is the most concise but loses some detail. Model 2 stays closest to the original structure and meaning. Model 3 provides the most learner support through additional explanations but deviates from the source text.

Strengths: Uses simple past tense appropriately (""lost"" vs ""were facing""), maintains clear sentence structure, and preserves all key information. The vocabulary is accessible while remaining accurate.

Weaknesses: Minor geographical error - states United Fruit operated ""in South America"" when the original refers to Central American operations. The cloning explanation could be clearer for A2 learners.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful clarification with ""like making exact copies"" to explain cloning concept. Uses appropriate A2-level vocabulary and maintains good flow between sentences.

Weaknesses: Contains the same geographical error as Model 1. The phrase ""didn't use seeds"" followed by ""Instead, they copied"" creates slight redundancy in explanation.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Explicitly defines cloning with ""this is called cloning,"" which is pedagogically useful for A2 learners. Maintains accurate information and uses clear, simple language throughout.

Weaknesses: Also contains the geographical error. The sentence structure is slightly more complex in places, though still within A2 range.

**Overall Comparison:**
All three models successfully simplify the original text for A2 level while maintaining the core message. They all use appropriate vocabulary and sentence structures. The main factual error across all models is the geographical reference. Model 3 provides the clearest explanation of technical concepts, while Model 1 offers the most natural flow.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and sentence structures appropriate for A2 level. Successfully simplifies complex concepts like ""stunning or killing prey"" to ""catch prey."" The phrase ""flick tiny, irritating hairs"" is clear and accessible.

Weaknesses: Loses some accuracy by omitting that venom is used to stun/kill prey specifically. The phrase ""caused no deaths"" is less precise than the original ""produced any fatalities."" Some nuance is lost in the simplification.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains more accuracy from the original text by including ""paralyze their prey."" Uses appropriate A2 vocabulary while preserving key information. The phrase ""shooting tiny, irritating hairs"" effectively conveys the defensive mechanism.

Weaknesses: ""Paralyze"" might be slightly above A2 level vocabulary. The sentence ""These hairs can get into the skin or eyes of whoever bothers them"" is somewhat awkward in construction.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains the most accuracy from the original text, including ""stun or kill their small prey"" and ""throwing tiny, irritating hairs into the air."" Maintains the specific detail about the hairs being ejected as a defense mechanism.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""common,"" ""having fun,"" ""weak,"" ""strong and clever""). The sentence structure is clear and straightforward. Successfully conveys the main concept.

Weaknesses: Loses some important details from the original text. ""Most resourceful person in the world"" is simplified to just ""clever,"" which reduces the emphasis. The translation is quite brief and omits the progression aspect of the character development.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains good A2-level vocabulary while preserving more detail than Model 1. Includes the progression element with ""as the story goes on"" and adds helpful context with ""fights to survive"" and ""beats the killer."" The structure flows well and is easy to follow.

Weaknesses: Uses ""late 1900s"" instead of ""late 20th century,"" which changes the time reference slightly. Some sentences could be considered slightly complex for A2 level with multiple clauses.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Preserves the key concept of ""last girl"" by putting it in quotes, maintaining the technical term. Uses appropriate A2 vocabulary and keeps most of the original meaning. Includes the superlative aspect (""strongest and smartest person"").

Weaknesses: ""Able to survive anything"" may be slightly advanced for A2 level. Like Model 2, uses ""late 1900s"" instead of the more precise ""late 20th century."" The phrase ""kind, quiet"" changes ""innocent, shy"" somewhat, altering the character description.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for A2 level. Good simplification of complex concepts like ""artefacts"" to ""objects left behind."" The phrase ""developed the body parts needed"" makes the concept very concrete and understandable.

Weaknesses: Changes ""when and why"" to ""how and why,"" which alters the original meaning. The phrase ""changed"" is less precise than ""evolved"" or ""developed"" when discussing evolutionary processes.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Opens with a clear, accessible explanation using ""learned to use complex language."" Uses simple vocabulary throughout and maintains good sentence structure. The phrase ""shape of the mouth, throat, and tongue"" adds helpful specificity.

Strengths: Uses very simple sentence structures that are highly accessible for A2 level (""comes out once a week,"" ""free to read""). The environmental explanation is clear and well-structured. Good use of basic connecting words.
Weaknesses: Less precise in some areas - ""People can find copies"" is vaguer than specifying faculty buildings. The transition between ideas could be smoother.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three models successfully simplify the vocabulary and sentence structure for A2 level. Model 2 retains the most complete information while remaining accessible. Model 1 provides a solid middle ground with natural phrasing. Model 3 uses the simplest language but sacrifices some specificity and flow.

Based on what we find, we will give suggestions to make the workplace better for employees and help keep more of them working here.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains professional tone while simplifying vocabulary. Uses clear, direct language (""leave each year"" instead of ""turnover""). Preserves all key information accurately.
Weaknesses: Uses ""industry average"" which may be challenging for A2 learners. The phrase ""reasons behind employee engagement"" could be clearer about what aspect of engagement is being investigated.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Excellent use of concrete numbers (""12 out of every 100"") which aids A2 comprehension. Adds helpful explanation ""That means we are losing more people than usual."" Clarifies the engagement concept with ""feel connected—or not connected—to their work.""
Weaknesses: Slightly longer than necessary for A2 level. Uses ""based on what we learn"" which adds words without significant clarity benefit.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses concrete numbers effectively. Specifies ""food industry"" which adds helpful context. Clear explanation of employee engagement as ""feel connected to their jobs."" Maintains appropriate length for A2 level.
Weaknesses: Mixes percentage format (""7 per cent"") with the concrete number format established earlier, creating inconsistency. The phrase ""give suggestions"" is less natural than ""suggest ways.""

**Key Differences:**
Model 1 maintains the most professional register but uses some challenging vocabulary. Model 2 provides the most detailed explanations and clarifications. Model 3 offers good balance but has formatting inconsistencies.

All models successfully simplify the complex business language while preserving the core meaning. Model 2 provides the clearest explanations for A2 learners, while Model 3 offers good simplification with helpful context.

119-a2,"So much of what the speaker said rang true. I honestly believe there's a danger that the more connected we are, the more isolated we feel. I don't think this is such an issue for my generation who've lived without technology for so long. We know how to be alone and, more importantly, we know that it's OK to be alone. But the under 20s are another kettle of fish. They're so busy communicating that they never experience the feeling of solitude and run the risk of not learning how to enjoy their own company. In addition, they're learning conversation through messages that can be edited and changed at the expense of learning the art of real conversation in real time with the person in front of you.",qwen3-235b-a22b-2507,"Much of what the speaker said felt true. I really think there’s a risk: the more connected we are, the lonelier we might feel. For my generation, this isn’t such a big problem. We’ve lived without technology for years.

Also, they are learning to talk through messages that they can change or fix before sending. This means they miss out on learning how to have real conversations, face to face, in real time.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and sentence structures appropriate for A2 level. Successfully conveys the main ideas about generational differences and technology's impact on solitude. The phrase ""young people under 20 are different"" effectively replaces the idiomatic ""another kettle of fish.""

Weaknesses: Loses some nuance from the original, particularly the concept of ""real time"" conversation. The ending feels somewhat abrupt and doesn't fully capture the contrast between edited messages and spontaneous conversation.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains clear A2-level language while preserving more detail from the original text. Effectively explains the concept of online communication and its effects. The explanation of missing out on face-to-face conversations is well-developed and includes the important detail about someone being ""right in front of them.""

Weaknesses: Slightly longer sentences in some places may challenge A2 readers. The phrase ""messaging or chatting online"" adds specificity not present in the original.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and clear sentence structures. Maintains the key contrast between edited messages and real-time conversation. The phrase ""in real time"" preserves an important concept from the original. Explains the editing aspect clearly with ""change or fix before sending.""

Weaknesses: Uses ""problem"" instead of ""risk"" or ""danger,"" which slightly changes the tone. Some sentences could be more concise for A2 level.

All three translations successfully adapt the complex original text to A2 level by removing difficult vocabulary like ""rang true,"" ""solitude,"" and ""at the expense of."" They all handle the idiomatic expression ""another kettle of fish"" appropriately by using simpler alternatives.

120-a2,"Don't always follow positive feedback with negative feedback. When positive and negative feedback always appear to go hand in hand, the positives can become devalued and ignored. Ensure there are times when positive feedback is given for its own sake and resist the temptation to offer constructive criticism.",qwen3-235b-a22b-2507,"Don’t always give negative feedback after positive feedback.

If you do, people might start to ignore the good comments because they expect something negative to follow. Sometimes, just give praise without adding criticism. Let the positive feedback stand on its own. This helps people feel truly appreciated.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level. Maintains the core message about separating positive and negative feedback. The phrase ""seem less important"" effectively conveys the devaluation concept.

Weaknesses: ""Get ignored"" is slightly informal. The sentence structure could be more varied to aid comprehension.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses clear, simple language suitable for A2 learners. The phrase ""people might start ignoring"" makes the subject more explicit than Model 1. Maintains concise structure while preserving the main points.

Weaknesses: Very similar to Model 1 with minimal differentiation. Could benefit from slightly more explanation of the concept.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides the most comprehensive explanation with additional context (""because they expect something negative to follow""). Includes extra guidance (""Let the positive feedback stand on its own"") and explains the benefit (""This helps people feel truly appreciated""). Uses varied sentence structures.

Weaknesses: Longer text may be more challenging for A2 learners to process. Some sentences could be considered slightly above A2 complexity level.

**Comparison:**
All three models successfully simplify the original text and use appropriate A2 vocabulary. Models 1 and 2 are nearly identical, with Model 2 making the subject slightly clearer by specifying ""people."" Model 3 provides more thorough explanation but at the cost of increased length and complexity.

For A2 level learners, Model 2 strikes the best balance between clarity and simplicity, while Model 3 offers the most complete understanding but may be too detailed for the target level.
