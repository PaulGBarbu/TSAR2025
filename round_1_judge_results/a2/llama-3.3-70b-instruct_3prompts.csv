Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and sentence structures appropriate for A2 level. The main message is clear and accessible.
Weaknesses: Omits several specific dream examples from the original text (teeth falling out, being naked in public). The simplification removes important content that helps readers relate to the concept.

**Model 2 Feedback:**
Strengths: Maintains simple language while including more dream examples than Model 1. Includes the teeth-related dream which many readers can identify with. Uses ""really understand"" which adds emphasis appropriately.
Weaknesses: Still omits the ""being naked in public"" dream example. The phrase ""having problems with your teeth"" is less specific than the original ""teeth falling out.""

**Model 3 Feedback:**
Strengths: Includes all the dream examples from the original text (flying, falling, losing teeth, being naked in public). Provides the most complete content coverage. Adds a helpful concluding sentence that reinforces the main concept. Uses ""losing teeth"" which is clearer than ""problems with teeth.""
Weaknesses: Slightly longer and more complex than the other versions, which may challenge some A2 learners. Uses ""naked"" instead of a simpler alternative.

All three models successfully simplify the vocabulary and sentence structure for A2 level. Model 3 provides the most comprehensive translation while maintaining accessibility. Model 2 offers a middle ground with good simplification and partial content retention. Model 1 prioritizes simplicity but sacrifices too much original content.

Strengths:
- Uses simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for A2 level
- Maintains all key information from the original text
- Clear and direct translation of complex concepts
- Good use of basic connectors (""and,"" ""some"")

Weaknesses:
- Loses the opening phrase that establishes this as an interesting case study
- ""People didn't want anymore"" is slightly awkward phrasing
- Misses the word ""remarkably"" which adds emphasis to the dogs' adaptation

**Model 2 Feedback:**

Strengths:
- Retains the opening that frames this as an interesting example
- Uses A2-appropriate vocabulary while maintaining the original structure
- Includes helpful explanation of traffic lights
- Good balance between simplification and completeness

Weaknesses:
- The traffic lights explanation, while helpful, adds information not present in the original
- ""Left behind"" may be slightly more complex than necessary for A2
- The added explanation makes the text longer than needed

**Model 3 Feedback:**

Strengths:
- Maintains the introductory framing effectively
- Includes explanations for both traffic lights and adaptation
- Uses clear, simple language throughout
- Explicitly explains the concept of adaptation

Weaknesses:
- Adds significant content not in the original (explanations of traffic lights and adaptation)
- Becomes considerably longer than the original
- The added explanations may be unnecessary for the context
- ""Experts"" instead of ""scientists"" changes the original terminology

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for A2 level. Maintains the main ideas from the original text.
Weaknesses: Omits that Wonder is Palacio's first novel. The phrase ""different face"" is somewhat vague compared to ""facial deformities."" Missing the specific mention of friendship as a discussion topic.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes that Wonder is Palacio's first book. Provides clear explanation of the girl's appearance with ""face that wasn't like most people's."" Covers all three discussion topics (bullying, friendship, being different) and maintains the personal perspective with ""including me.""
Weaknesses: The phrase ""being mean to others"" is less precise than ""bullying."" The ending mentions wanting to ""read her next book"" rather than see ""what she writes next.""

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses appropriate A2-level vocabulary. Covers the main discussion topics including friendship (""being a good friend""). Maintains the personal perspective and includes all key plot points.
Weaknesses: Does not mention that Wonder is Palacio's first novel. Like Model 2, ends with wanting to ""read her next book"" instead of seeing ""what she writes next.""

**Key Differences:**
Model 1 provides the simplest language but omits some details. Model 2 includes the most complete information and explains the facial difference most clearly. Model 3 falls between the other two in terms of detail but misses the ""first novel"" aspect.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and sentence structures appropriate for A2 level. Successfully conveys the main narrative points about Chloe's rats and her change of opinion through Martin's influence.

Weaknesses: Loses some nuance from the original, particularly the detail about Chloe losing count of explanations and her patient efforts. The phrase ""used to think the same"" is somewhat vague compared to the original's clearer progression of understanding.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains good A2-level vocabulary while preserving more of the original's meaning. Captures the concept of frequent explanations and Chloe's understanding of others' reactions. The flow between sentences is natural.

Weaknesses: Omits the temporal marker ""last year"" which provides helpful context. The phrase ""most people don't keep rats as pets"" slightly shifts the focus from people's negative reactions to simply not keeping them.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains the ""last year"" time reference from the original. Clearly explains the sequence of events and maintains the logical progression of Chloe's attitude change. Uses appropriate A2 vocabulary throughout.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""Chloe didn't like rats at first either"" adds ""at first"" which wasn't in the original. Some sentences are slightly longer than typical A2 level, though still comprehensible.

**Overall Comparison:**
All three models successfully adapt the text to A2 level using simpler vocabulary and shorter sentences. Model 2 best captures the essence of Chloe's repeated explanations to people. Model 3 provides the most complete information by including the time reference. Model 1 is the most simplified but loses some important details about the frequency and nature of Chloe's explanations.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""get hurt,"" ""die,"" ""chase""). Maintains the core message about baboons being in danger and the monitors' role. The sentence structure is clear and accessible.

Weaknesses: Omits the important detail about minimizing human-baboon conflicts. The phrase ""has helped a bit"" is somewhat informal. Missing the specific mention that baboons are an ""endangered species.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses varied vocabulary while staying at A2 level (""car crashes,"" ""power lines,"" ""shocked""). Includes the city's helping intention. Maintains good flow and readability. The phrase ""working a bit"" is clear.

Weaknesses: Also omits the human-baboon conflict aspect. Does not mention that baboons are an endangered species. ""Power lines"" might be slightly more advanced vocabulary than needed.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""still popular,"" ""important issues,"" ""unfair treatment""). The sentence structure is clear and accessible. Successfully conveys the main ideas about political messaging and beautification.

Weaknesses: Loses some specificity from the original text. ""Unfair treatment"" is less precise than covering war, inequality, and discrimination separately. The phrase ""just wanted to make beautiful things"" oversimplifies the artistic intent.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains good A2-level vocabulary while preserving more detail from the original. ""Drawing on walls"" effectively explains graffiti for beginners. Covers the three political issues (war, unfairness, treating people badly) more completely than Model 1. ""Dull city walls"" captures the meaning of ""grey"" walls well.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""treating people badly"" is somewhat vague as a translation of ""discrimination."" Some sentences could be shorter for A2 level.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and sentence structures appropriate for A2 level. Maintains the core meaning of the original text. The phrase ""more clothes and shoes than they used to"" effectively simplifies ""more than ever before.""

Weaknesses: Loses the connection between cheap prices and disposable treatment by using ""This means"" which creates a less clear causal relationship than the original ""so cheap that they can be treated like disposable items.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Preserves the causal relationship with ""These clothes are so cheap that people wear them..."" which maintains the original's logical flow. Uses A2-appropriate vocabulary while keeping the meaning intact. The repetition of ""cheap"" reinforces the connection between price and behavior.

Weaknesses: Minor redundancy with ""cheap"" appearing twice in close proximity, though this may actually aid comprehension at A2 level.

Strengths: Changes ""People see"" to ""We see"" which creates a more engaging, inclusive tone. Uses ""so people can"" which clearly shows the cause-and-effect relationship. Maintains appropriate vocabulary level and sentence complexity.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""People in Britain"" is slightly more formal than ""British people."" The change to first person (""We see"") alters the original's more objective tone, though this may be intentional for engagement.

Weaknesses: Loses some descriptive details from the original, such as the atlas comparison and the specific imagery of sweat patches. The phrase ""swished their tails"" may be slightly advanced for A2 level.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains more descriptive elements from the original, including the atlas/map comparison. Uses clear, simple sentence structures. The phrase ""moved their tails to get rid of flies"" is more explicit and easier to understand than ""swished.""

Weaknesses: The phrase ""Usually, he had a pale skin"" contains a grammatical error (should be ""pale skin"" without ""a""). Some sentences could be clearer in their connections.

Strengths: Provides the most complete adaptation while maintaining A2 accessibility. Retains the map comparison and adds helpful clarification with ""and he got paid for it."" Uses very clear, simple sentence structures throughout.

Weaknesses: Slightly longer sentences in some cases, though still within A2 range. The addition of explanatory phrases sometimes makes sentences less concise.

Strengths: Clarifies these are ""wild pigs,"" providing important context missing in other versions. Uses ""kinder way"" which effectively simplifies ""more peaceful action."" Maintains all key information from the original text.
Weaknesses: The phrase ""We will have to wait and see"" is slightly more complex than necessary for A2 level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very simple sentence structures and vocabulary. The phrase ""keep them away"" clearly explains the fence purpose. Maintains the causal relationship between warmer winters and pig population.
Weaknesses: ""Pigs were being shot"" uses passive voice which can be more difficult for A2 learners. The phrase ""winters are getting warmer"" adds a progressive aspect not present in the original.

**Ranking Analysis:**
Model 2 provides the most complete and accurate translation while maintaining A2-appropriate language. Model 1 follows closely but lacks the important ""wild"" specification. Model 3, while using simple language, introduces grammatical complexity through passive voice and progressive tense that may challenge A2 learners.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""controlled,"" ""angry,"" ""brave""). Maintains the core narrative structure and includes all key story elements. The sentence structure is clear and accessible.

Weaknesses: Changes ""futuristic Theseus"" to ""modern-day Theseus,"" which alters the original meaning. Omits that Crete is an island. Uses ""maze"" instead of explaining ""labyrinth.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains chronological accuracy with past tense throughout. Includes the geographical detail that Crete is an island. Provides a helpful explanatory note about labyrinths. Preserves ""modern-day"" while maintaining the essence of the comparison.

Weaknesses: Uses some potentially challenging vocabulary for A2 level (""complicated,"" ""rebelled""). The added note, while helpful, makes the text longer than necessary for the target level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very simple vocabulary suitable for A2 learners. Includes the island detail about Crete. Attempts to address the futuristic element by adding ""but in the future.""

Weaknesses: Contains a factual error by stating Theseus was ""one of the boys"" when the original specifies ""one of the youths"" (could be either gender). The phrase ""modern version of Theseus, but in the future"" is somewhat awkward and potentially confusing.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three models successfully simplify the vocabulary and sentence structure for A2 level. Model 2 provides the most complete information with helpful context. Model 1 offers the clearest, most straightforward adaptation. Model 3 has the simplest language but contains a factual inaccuracy.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for A2 level. Successfully simplifies ""conservation issues"" to ""protecting animals and their homes."" Maintains the core meaning while reducing complexity.

Weaknesses: Omits the inspirational aspect mentioned in the original text. The phrase ""make them healthy again"" implies animals are currently sick, which differs from the original meaning of treating illnesses in general.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes appropriate A2-level vocabulary. Uses ""taking care of"" which is simpler than ""conservation."" Maintains most key information from the original text.

Weaknesses: Changes ""provide"" to ""can also help"" which is less precise. The phrase ""left alone"" is less accurate than ""abandoned."" Like Model 1, ""make them healthy again"" misrepresents the research aspect.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains the inspirational element (""inspire them to care about animals"") that other models omit. Uses clear A2-level language throughout. Better preserves the structure and flow of the original text. ""Give a safe home"" is more natural than ""give a safe place.""

Weaknesses: Slightly longer than the other translations, though still appropriate for A2 level. Uses ""try to learn"" which could imply uncertainty about the research success.

Strengths: Maintains the formal tone and structure of the original text. Uses appropriate vocabulary like ""excessive,"" ""consumption,"" and ""stage protests."" Preserves the meaning accurately while simplifying complex phrases.

Weaknesses: Some vocabulary may be too advanced for A2 level (e.g., ""excessive,"" ""consumption,"" ""associated with""). The sentence structure remains relatively complex for the target level.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simpler vocabulary and explanations appropriate for A2 level (""buying too much,"" ""spending too much money""). Adds helpful clarification about shopping days and explains the concept clearly. Good balance between simplification and meaning preservation.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""reaction against"" might still be challenging for A2 learners. Some sentences could be shorter for better comprehension.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very simple vocabulary and sentence structures suitable for A2 level. Explains concepts in basic terms (""buying too many things,"" ""went to the US""). Breaks down complex ideas into understandable parts.

Weaknesses: The simplification sometimes makes the text repetitive and less natural. Some phrases are awkward (""do different things to show they don't want to buy things""). The flow is choppy due to oversimplification.

**Overall Assessment:**
Model 2 achieves the best balance for A2 level by simplifying vocabulary while maintaining natural flow. Model 1 retains too much complexity for the target level. Model 3 oversimplifies to the point of affecting readability and natural expression.

Weaknesses: Adds information not present in the original text (the explanation about studying stories and myths). Changes ""robots"" to ""machines"" unnecessarily. The additional explanation may exceed A2 complexity levels.

**Model 3 Feedback:**
Strengths: Retains the specific ""17 parts"" detail from the original. Maintains the ""call to adventure"" concept by explaining it as ""like a call to Luke."" Uses simple sentence structures and clear vocabulary. Preserves the transformative aspect of the message.
Weaknesses: Uses very short, choppy sentences that may sound unnatural. The phrase ""do something exciting and important"" is somewhat vague compared to the original's ""adventure.""

**Ranking Analysis:**
Model 3 best balances simplification with accuracy, retaining key details like the 17 stages and the call to adventure concept. Model 1 provides good simplification but loses important conceptual elements. Model 2 adds unauthorized information and may be too complex for A2 level despite good explanatory attempts.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level, maintains clear sentence structure, and preserves the main concept of the sharing economy. The translation is accurate and flows naturally.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""things they no longer need"" slightly shifts the meaning from ""underused"" to ""no longer needed."" Some nuance about profit generation is simplified but still conveyed.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses contractions (""don't"") which are common in everyday English, maintains good A2-level vocabulary, and accurately conveys the core message. The sentence structure is clear and accessible.

Weaknesses: Similar to Model 1, it changes ""underused"" to ""don't need anymore,"" which alters the original meaning. The translation is very similar to Model 1 with minor variations.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the concept of ""things they do not use"" which is closer to the original ""underused"" meaning. Adds an explanatory sentence at the end that helps clarify the sharing economy concept for A2 learners. Preserves the main ideas accurately.

Weaknesses: The additional explanation, while helpful, goes beyond the original text. The phrase ""make money from sharing"" is slightly less natural than ""make money by sharing.""

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""mix of random thoughts,"" ""working on memories""). The sentence structure is clear and accessible. Successfully simplifies complex concepts while maintaining the core meaning.

Weaknesses: Loses some precision from the original text. The phrase ""things that we don't know about ourselves"" is less specific than ""things hidden from our conscious mind."" The connection between understanding dreams and solving problems is somewhat weakened.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains good A2-level vocabulary while preserving more of the original meaning. The phrase ""secret feelings"" is more precise than Model 1's approach. Clearly presents the contrast between the two theories. The phrase ""sorting out what happened during the day"" effectively simplifies the memory organization concept.

Weaknesses: The sentence ""when it's sorting out what happened during the day"" could be slightly clearer about what ""it"" refers to, though context makes this understandable.

Strengths:
- Uses simple vocabulary and sentence structures appropriate for A2 level
- Maintains the core message about charity donations and unsold clothes
- Clear and concise presentation

Weaknesses:
- Omits the key concept that people don't realize they're part of the problem
- Loses the specific mention of recycling issues
- Doesn't explain what happens to clothes sent abroad (just mentions it causes problems)
- Removes the quantifier ""huge quantities"" which emphasizes the scale

Weaknesses:
- Slightly longer and more complex than typical A2 level
- The added definition makes the text longer than necessary
- Some phrases like ""go out of style"" could be simpler

**Model 3 Feedback:**

Strengths:
- Captures the concept that people don't realize they're part of the problem
- Explains 'fast fashion' within the text rather than as a separate definition
- Includes the recycling aspect that other models missed or simplified
- Maintains the emphasis on scale with ""huge amounts""

Weaknesses:

She had to pull a special sled with a tent and all her food through very cold weather and big snow storms. A glacier is a big piece of ice that moves very slowly. A sled is a vehicle that slides on snow, often used to carry things.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains clear narrative flow and preserves all key information from the original. Uses appropriate A2-level vocabulary consistently. The sentence structure is simplified effectively while keeping the story coherent.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""big accident"" is somewhat vague. ""Very hot weather"" loses the specific detail of 45°C heat mentioned in the original, though this may be appropriate for A2 level.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful clarification by explaining that a glacier is ""a deep hole in the ice"" and describing the sledge as ""a special sled."" Uses clear, accessible language throughout. Maintains good narrative structure.

Weaknesses: The explanation of glacier as ""a deep hole in the ice"" is factually incorrect - glaciers are large masses of ice, not holes. This creates a significant factual error that could mislead learners.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes educational definitions at the end for ""glacier"" and ""sled,"" which supports A2 learners. The glacier definition is factually accurate. Uses clear, simple language throughout.

Weaknesses: Changes ""ice storms"" to ""big snow storms,"" which alters the meaning slightly. The definitions at the end, while helpful, break the narrative flow and may not be the most natural way to integrate explanations.

**Overall Assessment:**
Model 1 provides the most accurate and natural translation while maintaining appropriate A2 complexity. Model 2 contains a significant factual error about glaciers. Model 3 offers educational value but with some content changes and formatting that interrupts the narrative flow.

Now, he wants to make people think about problems in society. He paints pictures of people who don't have homes in big cities to make people think about this issue.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level. Clearly identifies Blek le Rat as a street artist, providing helpful context. Adds the concept of ""help"" which makes the purpose more concrete for A2 learners. Sentence structure is straightforward and accessible.

Weaknesses: Adds information not present in the original text (the word ""help""). Changes ""encourage residents to think"" to a more general ""wants people to think and help,"" which slightly alters the meaning.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the original meaning accurately. Uses appropriate A2-level vocabulary. Preserves the specific mention of ""where he lives"" which connects to the original ""his home city."" The phrase structure remains clear and simple.

Weaknesses: The sentence ""He paints pictures of people who don't have homes in big cities to help people think about this issue"" could be clearer in its purpose statement.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Stays very close to the original text structure and meaning. Uses simple, appropriate vocabulary for A2 level. Maintains the geographical reference to Paris as ""his city."" Clear and direct sentence construction.

Weaknesses: The repetition of ""to make people think"" in the last sentence creates slight redundancy. Could have varied the expression for better flow.

All three translations successfully simplify ""homeless people"" to ""people who don't have homes"" and ""social issues and problems"" to ""problems in society,"" which are appropriate A2-level adaptations. Each translation maintains the core message while using vocabulary suitable for the target level.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level, maintains clear sentence structure, preserves the main examples (Taiwan and São Paulo).
Weaknesses: Loses the nuance that councils are trying to ""encourage"" rather than just ""stop"" artists. Omits the concept of ""randomly"" painting, which changes the meaning from redirecting random graffiti to simply stopping all graffiti. Missing the clarification that São Paulo is in Brazil.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Captures the permission aspect with ""without permission,"" uses A2-appropriate vocabulary, includes geographical clarification ""a city in Brazil,"" maintains the concept of free expression with ""paint freely.""
Weaknesses: Changes ""subway trains"" to ""underground trains,"" which alters the specific terminology. The phrase ""paint freely"" adds emphasis not present in the original.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes the permission concept, provides clear geographical context (""Taiwan is a country,"" ""a city in Brazil""), maintains specific terminology like ""graffiti artists"" and ""subway trains,"" adds helpful clarification with ""without problems.""
Weaknesses: Slightly longer sentences that may challenge A2 readers, adds explanatory elements not in the original text.

All three models successfully simplify the vocabulary and sentence structure for A2 level. Model 1 has the most significant meaning change by omitting the ""randomly/without permission"" concept. Model 2 makes an unnecessary terminology change. Model 3 provides the most complete information while maintaining accessibility, though it adds some explanatory content.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and sentence structures appropriate for A2 level. Successfully conveys the main concepts about Faith47's art and philosophy. The phrase ""Things end and new things start"" effectively simplifies the original's complex idea about life cycles.

Weaknesses: ""She likes to paint in different places"" is somewhat vague compared to the original's ""explore different locations."" The word ""destroyed"" may be slightly strong for A2 level when describing weather effects on art.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains clear, simple language suitable for A2 learners. Adds the specific detail ""rain"" which makes the weather concept more concrete and easier to understand. Good use of basic vocabulary throughout.

Weaknesses: ""She likes to travel to different places to make her art"" changes the meaning from exploring locations for art placement to traveling, which isn't quite the same concept. Uses ""destroyed"" which may be challenging vocabulary for A2 level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses appropriate A2-level vocabulary and maintains clarity. The phrase ""the people who clean the city"" effectively simplifies ""cleaners from the city council."" The final sentence about life philosophy is well-structured and comprehensible.

Weaknesses: ""Soon, the weather or the people who clean the city will remove it"" is slightly more complex grammatically than necessary for A2 level. The explanation of the life philosophy, while accurate, uses more complex sentence structure.

**Overall Comparison:**
All three models successfully reduce the text to A2 level while preserving the core meaning. Model 1 and Model 3 better maintain the original meaning of exploring different locations for art placement, while Model 2 introduces the travel concept.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for A2 level. Successfully conveys the basic contrast between the two work cultures. The coach metaphor is retained and simplified effectively.

Weaknesses: Loses the technical terms ""high power distance"" and ""low power distance"" culture without providing any framework for understanding these concepts. The phrase ""didn't mind being questioned"" understates the expectation aspect from the original text.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains clear, simple language suitable for A2 learners. Preserves the key contrast between workplace cultures. Uses ""those in charge"" as an effective simplification. Includes the mentoring/advising role of leaders.

Weaknesses: Does not explain the cultural framework concepts. The phrase ""wanted people to think for themselves and share their opinions"" somewhat dilutes the stronger ""expect to be challenged"" from the original.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses accessible vocabulary while maintaining more detail from the original. Provides better context by explaining ""this kind of workplace"" twice, helping readers understand there are different workplace types.

Strengths: Maintains more detail from the original text while keeping language accessible. Includes the important concept that the team saw Gabriela's reaction as taking things as ""a personal attack"" and explains their normal working process of ""discussing and trying to improve ideas.""
Weaknesses: Some phrases like ""questioned or wanted to change her decisions"" and ""personal attack"" might be slightly challenging for A2 learners. The sentence structure is occasionally more complex than typical A2 level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses clear, simple language appropriate for A2 level. Includes key details like the team explaining their normal working methods and clarifying they ""didn't mean to upset her."" Maintains the important point about Gabriela taking things as a personal attack.
Weaknesses: Like Model 1, omits the concept of ""cultural differences"" which was central to the original text. Some repetition in explaining the team's feelings about being told what to do.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""thousands of years,"" ""humans,"" ""scientists""). Maintains the core meaning while simplifying complex terms like ""archaeologists"" to ""scientists.""
Weaknesses: Omits Syria from the list of countries. Changes ""magic spells"" to ""magic words,"" which loses some specificity. The phrase ""magic words"" is less clear than the original concept.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes all countries mentioned in the original (Greece, Italy, Syria, Iraq). Uses consistent simple vocabulary. Explains Latin as ""a language called Latin,"" which helps A2 learners. Uses ""researchers"" as an alternative to ""archaeologists.""

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""very high mountain,"" ""cold place,"" ""big areas of land""). Maintains the core message about modern vs. past exploration methods and charitable purposes.

Weaknesses: Loses specific references to Mount Everest and South Pole, making the text less engaging. The phrase ""special tools"" is vague compared to ""compasses."" Omits the comparison structure ""Unlike the explorers of the past.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains engaging superlatives (""tallest mountain,"" ""coldest place on Earth"") while keeping language accessible. Preserves the motivational aspects and charitable purposes clearly. Uses appropriate A2 vocabulary throughout.

Weaknesses: Still removes specific landmark names (Mount Everest, South Pole). The phrase ""devices that show them where they are"" is somewhat lengthy for A2 level. Doesn't mention the contrast structure from the original.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for A2 level. Maintains the core technical information accurately. The sentence structure is clear and accessible.

Weaknesses: Omits the full name ""Double Asteroid Redirection Test"" and loses the specific name ""Didymoon."" The phrase ""might change its orbit"" is less precise than the original's intention of definitively knocking it out of orbit.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Explains the concept clearly with phrases like ""special project to change the path of an asteroid."" Uses accessible vocabulary while maintaining accuracy. Includes the purposeful nature of the mission with ""Scientists want to crash DART.""

Weaknesses: Does not include the full form ""Double Asteroid Redirection Test"" or the name ""Didymoon."" The explanation, while clear, adds interpretive elements not present in the original.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides the complete expansion ""Double Asteroid Redirection Test."" Retains the specific name ""Didymoon"" from the original text. Maintains all key factual details while using A2-appropriate language. The progression of information follows the original structure closely.

Weaknesses: Slightly longer than the other versions, though still within A2 complexity. Uses ""stands for"" which may be marginally more advanced vocabulary.

**Ranking Analysis:**
Model 3 preserves the most original content including technical terms and proper names while maintaining A2 accessibility. Model 2 provides good clarity and explanation but sacrifices some original terminology. Model 1 is the most simplified but loses important specific details from the source text.

Strengths: Uses simple sentence structures appropriate for A2 level. Maintains all key plot points from the original. The phrase ""dangerous game"" effectively simplifies ""tributes"" concept.
Weaknesses: Loses the specific location name ""District 12"" in one instance, referring only to ""her home."" The transition between sentences could be smoother.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very accessible vocabulary like ""bad accident"" and ""little sister."" Maintains good flow between ideas. The phrase ""mixed feelings"" is simpler than ""complicated feelings.""
Weaknesses: Replaces ""District 12"" with ""her area,"" losing important story context. The term ""picked"" is somewhat informal for the selection process.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains the full name ""Katniss Everdeen"" and consistently uses ""District 12,"" preserving important story elements. Maintains logical sequence of events. Uses clear, simple vocabulary throughout.
Weaknesses: Slightly longer sentences that approach the upper limit of A2 complexity. The phrase ""who has to play the game"" adds unnecessary length.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for A2 level. Maintains the core message about dream journaling and connecting dreams to daily life.
Weaknesses: Loses the specific timeframe reference (""over the period of a week""). The phrase ""things that happen in your life"" is somewhat vague compared to the original's ""events.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes ""writing down"" which is more concrete than just ""writing about."" Adds ""every day"" which clarifies the daily life connection. Uses ""try to connect"" which is more encouraging and A2-appropriate.
Weaknesses: Still omits the week timeframe reference. The sentence structure could be slightly more varied.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Preserves more original meaning, including the surprise element and the week timeframe. Explains the purpose of noting people and places (""help you understand what your dream means""). Maintains the logical flow of the original text.
Weaknesses: Slightly more complex sentence structure with some longer sentences that approach A2+ level. Uses ""connected to"" which is more sophisticated vocabulary.

**Comparison:**

This was a big problem with old train bridges. When trains moved on the tracks, they made sparks.

Strengths: Maintains the core meaning accurately while using simpler vocabulary. The sentence structure is appropriate for A2 level with clear cause-and-effect relationships. Successfully simplifies ""susceptible to fire"" to ""easily caught fire"" and ""burn to the ground"" to ""destroy it.""

Weaknesses: The explanation of how sparks are created is somewhat compressed, which may make the causal relationship less clear for A2 learners. Uses ""set the bridge on fire"" which might be slightly advanced vocabulary.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides the clearest explanation of the spark creation process by breaking it into separate sentences. The phrase ""sparks would fly"" is vivid and comprehensible. Explains that wheels and tracks are metal, which helps A2 learners understand why sparks occur. Uses simple sentence structures throughout.

Weaknesses: Slightly longer than necessary for A2 level. The word ""completely"" at the end is somewhat redundant since ""burn down"" already implies total destruction.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very simple sentence structures with short, clear statements. Breaks complex ideas into digestible pieces. The phrase ""This was a big problem"" adds helpful context for A2 learners. Uses basic vocabulary throughout.

Weaknesses: Loses some precision from the original text. ""When trains moved on the tracks, they made sparks"" oversimplifies the mechanism and doesn't explain that the sparks come from wheel-track contact. The connection between metal components and spark creation is missing entirely.

Strengths: Uses simple sentence structures and basic vocabulary appropriate for A2 level. The phrase ""definitely here to stay"" maintains some of the original's emphasis. Clear and direct communication.
Weaknesses: Loses the opening concept of impossibility to predict the future. The transition between ideas is abrupt. ""Different countries"" is less precise than the original's global scope.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the uncertainty concept from the original with ""can't know for sure."" Uses appropriate A2 vocabulary while preserving more nuanced ideas. The explanation ""which means they think it's a real kind of art"" adds helpful clarification for A2 readers.
Weaknesses: Slightly longer sentences that may challenge A2 readers. The phrase ""take street art seriously"" might be less clear than direct alternatives.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Preserves the concept of emerging trends from the original. Uses ""different parts of the world"" which accurately reflects the global scope. Maintains the structure of contrasting current and emerging practices.
Weaknesses: ""Continue to exist"" is weaker than the original's emphatic ""here to stay."" Uses ""Some artists"" instead of ""Other artists,"" which changes the meaning slightly. The word ""exist"" may be less engaging for A2 learners.

Strengths: Maintains factual accuracy by correctly identifying the father as a US Air Force pilot. Uses simple sentence structures appropriate for A2 level. Preserves the key emotional impact with ""very scary.""

Weaknesses: The phrase ""keep the truth from her"" may be too abstract for A2 learners. Omits the emotional context that news programs are ""upsetting"" to Suzanne as an adult.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""very hungry, sick and tired,"" ""big storms""). Maintains the mystery element with ""It's a surprise."" Preserves the 227-day timeframe and key plot elements.
Weaknesses: ""They don't give up"" doesn't accurately convey ""survive"" - the original suggests they managed to stay alive rather than showing determination. Changes ""shame to give away the ending"" to ""surprise,"" which alters the author's tone about spoilers.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Simplifies ""lifeboat"" to ""small boat"" for A2 comprehension. Uses clear, simple sentence structures. Adds personal perspective with ""I don't want to tell you"" which makes the text more direct.
Weaknesses: ""Everything gets better"" suggests a positive resolution, while the original ""everything changes"" is neutral and maintains suspense. The personal ""I don't want to"" changes the narrative voice from the original third-person perspective.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains ""lifeboat"" terminology while keeping language simple. Uses ""lonely"" which closely matches the original ""loneliness."" Preserves the temporal element with ""After a long time.""
Weaknesses: ""Everything gets better"" again suggests a positive outcome rather than neutral change. ""It's exciting to find out"" adds enthusiasm not present in the original, which was more cautious about spoilers.

Weaknesses: None significant for A2 level adaptation.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses compound sentences appropriately for A2 level. Changes ""beloved jazz"" to ""favourite music"" which maintains some of the original sentiment while being more accessible. Preserves the parallel structure in the list.
Weaknesses: Uses ""didn't do it yet"" which sounds less natural than other options. The phrase structure is slightly more complex than necessary in some parts.

**Comparison:**
All three models successfully simplify vocabulary (removing ""beloved jazz,"" ""chatter"") and sentence structures for A2 level. Model 2 flows most naturally while maintaining simplicity. Model 1 over-simplifies by breaking sentences unnecessarily. Model 3 falls between the other two but has some awkward phrasing.

All models preserve the essential meaning and narrative structure of the original text while making it accessible to A2 learners.

NASA is trying to find all these rocks to keep Earth safe.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""big rocks,"" ""close to our planet""). Maintains the key numerical information (90%, 887, 50). Includes the reassuring conclusion about safety.

Weaknesses: Loses the specific measurement ""1km wide."" The phrase ""anything that comes within 50 million kilometres"" is imprecise compared to the original's reference to Earth's orbit. Does not mention the planetary defense team context.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains the team concept from the original. Uses A2-appropriate vocabulary while keeping ""as wide as a mountain"" which preserves the size comparison. Maintains all key numbers and the safety message.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""things in space that are close to our planet"" is somewhat vague. Does not specify the 1km measurement. The connection to Earth's orbit is simplified to just distance.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Mentions the NASA team and uses simple vocabulary. Correctly references ""Earth's path around the sun"" which better captures the orbital concept. Includes an additional explanatory sentence about NASA's protective mission. Maintains all numerical data.

Weaknesses: Does not include the specific 1km measurement. The added final sentence, while contextually appropriate, was not in the original text.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three translations successfully simplify the vocabulary for A2 level and preserve the essential safety message. Model 3 provides the most complete context by explaining Earth's orbit and NASA's protective role. Model 2 maintains good accuracy while using appropriate simplification. Model 1, while clear, loses some precision in technical details.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for A2 level. Successfully conveys the main plot points and maintains clarity throughout.

Weaknesses: Loses significant detail from the original text. The phrase ""something big happens"" is vague compared to the original's ""unexpected and traumatic event."" Omits the specific mention of 'the plague' concept and the ""behind their hands"" detail. The translation feels oversimplified and loses some narrative nuance.

**Model 2 Feedback:**

Strengths: Maintains good narrative flow while using A2-appropriate vocabulary. Successfully adapts complex phrases like ""talking about him behind their hands"" to ""talking about him when they think he can't hear."" Preserves most key story elements and character relationships.

Weaknesses: Changes ""school camp"" to ""school trip,"" which alters the specific setting. The phrase ""something very upsetting happens"" doesn't fully capture the intensity of ""unexpected and traumatic event."" Some minor details are simplified.

**Model 3 Feedback:**

Strengths: Retains the most detail from the original text while maintaining A2 accessibility. Preserves the ""school camp"" setting accurately. Uses ""very sad and shocking"" which better captures the traumatic nature of the event. Maintains the narrative structure with appropriate simplification.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for A2 level. Maintains the core narrative elements and dialogue structure with clear thought attribution.
Weaknesses: Loses some descriptive detail from the original, such as ""heavy hooves"" becoming just ""kicking the ground."" The phrase ""whole load of trouble"" is simplified to just ""trouble,"" reducing the emphasis.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains more descriptive elements like ""big feet"" for hooves and ""went on and on as far as they could see."" Uses A2-appropriate vocabulary while maintaining narrative flow. Includes the contrast between the two types of trouble the boy might face.
Weaknesses: The phrase ""hard to spot"" may be slightly advanced for A2 level. Some sentence structures are longer than typical A2 texts.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains good narrative structure and includes specific details like ""this horse"" in the dialogue. Uses simple vocabulary and clear sentence construction. Preserves the comparison between different levels of danger.
Weaknesses: The phrase ""went on forever"" is more idiomatic and may be challenging for A2 learners. The sentence ""But if the boy didn't know how to ride and still wanted to get away from his father, he could get into even more trouble"" is quite long and complex for A2 level.

**Overall Comparison:**

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for A2 level. Clear structure and easy to follow.
Weaknesses: Oversimplifies ""violent storms"" to just ""bad weather,"" losing some meaning. ""After school"" is ambiguous - could mean daily after school rather than after completing education.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains more detail from the original text, including ""storms"" and ""very cold weather."" Better captures the meaning of ""fell in love with"" by using ""started loving."" Uses ""finished school"" which clarifies the timing better than Model 1.
Weaknesses: ""Big mountains"" is less precise than ""high mountains."" The phrase ""new and harder things"" adds interpretation not present in the original.

Strengths: Uses simple sentence structures and basic vocabulary appropriate for A2 level. Clearly explains the oxygen danger and its effects on the brain and body.
Weaknesses: Loses the causal relationship from the original (""Having climbed Everest"" becomes just ""climbed""). Omits the detail about orphans, only mentioning ""poor children."" The connection between climbing Everest and deciding to climb other peaks is unclear.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the logical sequence better by explaining that after Everest, she wants to climb ""all the other very high mountains."" Includes both ""poor kids and children without parents,"" preserving the orphans detail. Uses simple vocabulary while being comprehensive.
Weaknesses: Uses ""kids"" which may be too informal for some A2 contexts. The phrase ""make it harder for herself"" adds interpretation not present in the original.

Strengths: Maintains the core meaning of the original text and uses appropriate A2-level vocabulary. The sentence structure is simplified effectively while preserving key information about pack behavior, metro usage, and scientific theories.

Weaknesses: Changes ""packs"" to ""groups"" which loses some specificity. The phrase ""move around their area"" is less precise than the original ""get from one part of their territory to another."" The final sentence loses the connection to ""locals"" specifically.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains more of the original meaning by keeping ""more likely to"" which shows probability. Uses ""ask for food"" which is appropriate for A2 level. Maintains the complete structure of the final sentence better than Model 1.

Weaknesses: Also changes ""packs"" to ""groups."" The phrase ""ask for food"" is less accurate than ""beg for food"" as it doesn't capture the specific behavior described. Uses ""area"" instead of ""territory.""

Changes ""have learned"" to ""learn"" in one instance, which affects the meaning. The phrase ""so they don't really notice them"" changes the causal relationship in the final sentence.

**Ranking Analysis:**
Model 2 preserves the most accurate meaning while maintaining A2-appropriate language. Model 1 provides good simplification but loses some precision. Model 3 makes the most significant changes to meaning and structure, particularly in the opening and the concept of pack coordination.

Strengths: Concise and clear translation that captures the main concepts effectively. Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level. Maintains the core message about companies creating platforms to connect customers with service providers.

Weaknesses: Omits the concept of ""underutilised resources"" which is central to the original text's meaning. The explanation lacks some detail about how these platforms function as intermediaries.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses accessible language suitable for A2 learners. Includes helpful explanatory phrases like ""This way, homeowners can make some extra money"" that aid comprehension. Maintains good flow between examples.

Weaknesses: The opening phrase ""see the benefits of sharing"" oversimplifies the original concept of profitability in the sharing economy. Does not clearly convey the middleman role of these companies.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Most comprehensive translation that includes the key concept of underutilized resources (""things that people do not use all the time""). Provides detailed explanations for both examples. Uses repetitive structure that reinforces learning at A2 level.

Weaknesses: Somewhat repetitive phrasing that could be streamlined. The sentence ""They want to use things that people do not use all the time"" is slightly awkward grammatically.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""main jobs,"" ""in danger,"" ""having babies""). Successfully simplifies complex concepts like genetic diversity to ""variety of genes."" Maintains clear sentence structure throughout.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""variety of genes"" may still be challenging for A2 learners. Some sentences could be shorter for better comprehension.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Effectively breaks down complex ideas into simple language (""animals that are in danger of disappearing""). Uses very accessible vocabulary and explains the genetic concept clearly with ""mixing their genes."" Good use of connecting words like ""so.""

Weaknesses: Contains some longer sentences that might challenge A2 readers. The explanation of genetic mixing, while clear, introduces additional complexity.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and clear sentence structure appropriate for A2 level. Maintains the core message about brain plasticity and the importance of process-focused praise. The flow is natural and easy to follow.

Weaknesses: Loses some specificity from the original text, such as the ""growth mindset"" concept and the detailed explanation of problem-solving strategies. The phrase ""get even better at things they're already good at"" is somewhat awkward.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Introduces Carol Dweck clearly and explains the brain's ability to change in simple terms. Uses accessible vocabulary while preserving the main ideas. The examples are well-adapted for A2 level.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""finding new ways to do things"" is vague compared to the original's specific mention of ""experimentation and problem-solving strategies."" Some nuance about the plasticity concept is lost.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides the most comprehensive explanation of the concept while maintaining A2-level language. Includes specific examples of process-focused praise (""You tried really hard"" and ""You found a good way to solve this problem""). Clearly explains both the problem with current praise methods and the solution.

Weaknesses: Slightly longer than the others, which might challenge some A2 readers. Changes ""events"" to ""parties,"" which narrows the original meaning.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three models successfully simplify the complex psychological concepts for A2 level readers. Model 3 provides the most complete information while remaining accessible. Model 2 offers a good balance of simplicity and content retention. Model 1 is the most concise but sacrifices some important details.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and sentence structures appropriate for A2 level. Maintains the core scientific information while simplifying complex terms. The phrase ""like the planet is breathing"" effectively conveys the original metaphor.

Weaknesses: Loses the specific detail about ""thousands of tons"" which provides important scale information. The phrase ""releases a lot of methane into the air at times"" is somewhat vague compared to the original's precision.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Introduces methane clearly as ""a simple but important substance"" before naming it, which aids comprehension. Uses accessible language while preserving key concepts. The breathing metaphor is well-adapted as ""taking breaths.""

Weaknesses: Omits the specific quantity ""thousands of tons"" entirely. The phrase ""doesn't last very long"" followed by ""only a few hundred years"" creates a slight contradiction in perspective, as hundreds of years might seem long to A2 learners.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains the specific detail ""thousands of tons at a time"" which preserves important quantitative information from the original. Provides clear explanation of the replenishment concept with ""making more methane to replace the old methane."" Uses appropriate A2-level vocabulary throughout.

Weaknesses: Slightly more complex sentence structure in some parts. The explanation ""to replace the old methane"" adds length that might challenge A2 readers, though it aids understanding.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three translations successfully adapt the text to A2 level by simplifying vocabulary and sentence structures. Model 3 provides the most complete information transfer while maintaining accessibility. Model 2 offers good explanatory elements but loses important details. Model 1 is the most concise but sacrifices some precision.

Strengths: Maintains the original structure well, uses appropriate A2-level vocabulary, and preserves all key concepts including both mindset types and their consequences. The sentence flow is natural and the meaning remains clear.

Weaknesses: Some phrases like ""reacted well to the challenge"" could be more explicit about the positive nature of the reaction. The connection between growth mindset and future focus could be clearer.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very accessible A2 vocabulary, includes helpful explanations of both mindset concepts (""which means they think about..."" and ""which means they thought their abilities wouldn't change""), and maintains all essential information from the original.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""were happy to try"" doesn't fully capture that they ""loved challenge"" from the original. The structure becomes slightly repetitive with the explanatory phrases.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for A2 level, repeats Carol Dweck's name for clarity, and breaks down complex concepts into digestible parts. The explanation ""they believed they would always be the same"" effectively simplifies the fixed mindset concept.

Weaknesses: Loses some specificity from the original - ""liked a challenge"" is weaker than ""loved challenge,"" and ""could get better at things"" is more vague than the original's focus on developing abilities. The repetition of ""Carol Dweck called this"" creates awkward phrasing.

**Ranking Analysis:**
Model 2 provides the clearest explanations of both mindsets while maintaining factual accuracy. Model 1 preserves the original structure and meaning most faithfully. Model 3, while simple, loses some important nuances and has less natural phrasing.

Weaknesses: ""Ghost towns"" is omitted in the list but mentioned in the original. The phrase ""Another good thing"" is somewhat informal compared to the original's tone.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful clarification with ""a hospital that nobody uses"" and ""a town where nobody lives,"" which aids A2 comprehension. Includes all location types from the original. Uses ""move away"" instead of ""leave,"" which is clearer for A2 learners.

Weaknesses: ""There's something strange"" changes the meaning from the original's ""something about,"" which implies mystery rather than strangeness. The word ""big"" is added unnecessarily to ""empty house.""

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains good vocabulary level for A2. Includes explanatory phrases like ""towns where nobody lives."" Adds ""which makes the story more realistic"" to clarify the phone signal point.

Weaknesses: ""There's something interesting"" significantly alters the original meaning, removing the mysterious/unsettling tone that's central to the horror context. ""Still lived there"" adds an unnecessary word. The addition about making stories ""more realistic"" goes beyond the original text's scope.

**Overall Assessment:**
Model 1 stays closest to the original meaning while using appropriate A2 vocabulary. Model 2 provides helpful clarifications but makes minor meaning changes.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the universal nature with ""always a frightening place."" Uses A2-appropriate vocabulary while preserving more original meaning. Includes the concept of going ""down"" stairs which adds spatial clarity. Captures the final sentiment about emptiness with ""even when there's nothing scary downstairs.""

Weaknesses: Uses ""wet"" instead of ""damp"" which slightly changes the meaning. The phrase ""a bit spooky"" understates the original's emphasis. ""Set of stairs"" is slightly more complex than necessary for A2 level.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear vocabulary throughout. Maintains the structure of the original text well. Uses ""wet"" as a simple alternative to ""damp."" Preserves the final emphasis with ""even when there's nothing bad down there.""

Weaknesses: Opens with ""often scary"" rather than emphasizing that basements are universally scary in horror movies, which weakens the impact. ""A little frightening"" significantly understates the original's ""creepy."" Misses the opening context about ""any kind of house.""

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""really interesting,"" ""improve ourselves,"" ""remembering stuff""). The sentence structure is straightforward and accessible.
Weaknesses: Loses the concept of ""augmenting our bodies"" entirely, which removes an important aspect of the original meaning. ""Remembering stuff"" is overly casual and may not be suitable for all contexts.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains the body augmentation concept through ""adding technology to our bodies."" Uses ""tiny computer"" which helps A2 learners visualize the concept better. Maintains appropriate vocabulary level while preserving more original meaning.
Weaknesses: Slightly longer sentences that might challenge some A2 learners. The phrase ""adding technology to our bodies"" could still be complex for lower A2 levels.

The connection between parental behavior and children's phone use while doing homework is less clear. ""Driving"" is an inaccurate interpretation of ""waiting at a red light.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the logical connection between parental behavior and expectations for teenagers. Uses appropriate A2 vocabulary while preserving the cause-and-effect relationship. Includes specific examples like ""cooking dinner"" and ""waiting in traffic.""
Weaknesses: ""Waiting in traffic"" is not entirely accurate to the original ""waiting at a red light."" The phrase structure is slightly more complex than typical A2 level in some sentences.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Most accurately preserves the original meaning, including the specific detail about ""waiting for the traffic light to turn green."" Maintains the logical argument structure about parental influence. Uses clear, simple language appropriate for A2 level.
Weaknesses: Some sentences are slightly longer and more complex than ideal for A2 level. The phrase ""waiting for the traffic light to turn green"" is more detailed than necessary for the target level.

**Overall Comparison:**
All three models successfully simplify the idiom ""hit the nail on the head"" and complex vocabulary. Model 1 provides the simplest language but sacrifices accuracy. Model 2 balances simplicity with meaning preservation reasonably well. Model 3 maintains the highest fidelity to the original content while still using accessible language.

Strengths:
- Uses simple, clear language appropriate for A2 level
- Maintains the core message and statistics accurately
- Good sentence structure with appropriate conjunctions
- Preserves the contrast between perception and reality

Weaknesses:

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for A2 level. Successfully conveys the main concept of the ""sandwich"" feedback method and its problems.
Weaknesses: Loses some specificity from the original text. The phrase ""nice comments with bad news in between"" doesn't clearly explain the sandwich structure. Omits the concept that positive feedback should reinforce good performance.

Note: ""autonomous"" is not a simple word, but it's necessary to explain the idea. It means the robots can work and make decisions without humans controlling them. In this case, it's used as ""decide who to kill on their own"" to simplify the concept. ""Unethical"" is also not a simple word, but it's explained as ""very wrong"" to keep the original tone and meaning.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level. Maintains clear structure and logical flow.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""You might think of robots like the Terminator, but that's not what I'm talking about"" doesn't fully capture the original's instruction to ""forget the movie image"" and shift focus to current reality. Loses some specificity by omitting ""gun turrets and sentry robots.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses A2-appropriate vocabulary. Simplifies complex concepts effectively. Includes ""robots with guns"" which partially covers the missing military equipment types. Maintains the cautionary tone of the original.

Weaknesses: The opening instruction ""Don't think of robots like in movies, killing people"" is confusing and contradictory - it tells readers not to think of movie robots killing people, then immediately mentions killing people. This creates logical confusion. The transition between dismissing movie images and discussing reality is unclear.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides clear contrast between movie fiction and reality with ""but this is real."" Uses simple vocabulary throughout. Includes helpful explanatory note about ""autonomous"" and ""unethical"" for educational purposes. Maintains all key concepts from the original text. The transition from movie imagery to current reality is smooth and logical.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for A2 level. Successfully conveys the main message about increasing protected ocean areas from 3% to 10%. The phrase ""time is running out"" effectively simplifies ""the clock is ticking.""

Weaknesses: Omits specific human activities mentioned in the original (overfishing, polluting, littering). Lacks mention of the Red Sea location. Uses vague terms like ""damage"" and ""empty areas"" without explaining the specific environmental issues described in the source text.

**Model 2 Feedback:**

Strengths: Includes all three human activities from the original text (overfishing, pollution, littering) using A2-appropriate language. Mentions the Red Sea specifically. Provides clear explanations like ""taking too many fish"" for overfishing. Maintains good sentence structure for the target level.

Weaknesses: Slightly longer sentences that may challenge some A2 learners. The phrase ""putting bad things in the water"" is somewhat imprecise compared to the original concept of pollution.

**Model 3 Feedback:**

Strengths: Covers all main points including specific human activities and the Red Sea reference. Uses appropriate vocabulary for A2 level. The phrase ""we need to act quickly"" effectively conveys urgency. Maintains clarity while being comprehensive.

Weaknesses: Some sentences approach the upper limit of complexity for A2 level. The transition between ideas could be smoother in places.

Strengths: Maintains appropriate A2 vocabulary level with simple sentence structures. Successfully conveys the main biographical information and career progression. The phrase ""keep to herself"" effectively translates ""keep quiet"" in context.

Weaknesses: Omits the specific award name (Olive Crime Writer Award) and the TV show name (Police Today). The phrase ""happy to talk"" doesn't capture the contrast implied by ""not so quiet these days."" Lacks the specific detail about ""writing conferences.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses clear A2-level language while maintaining good narrative flow. Includes important clarification that she ""never used this skill for anything bad."" Effectively conveys the personality transformation from shy to outgoing. Mentions both TV shows and writing events.

Weaknesses: Omits the specific award name and TV show title. Uses ""keep a low profile"" which may be slightly above A2 level. The phrase ""not shy anymore"" somewhat oversimplifies the original meaning.

Strengths: Uses simple sentence structures and basic vocabulary appropriate for A2 level. Successfully simplifies complex concepts like ""tribalism, fatalism and distrust"" into ""emotions and fear."" Maintains the core message about human progress and threats to Enlightenment values.

Weaknesses: Omits ""freer"" from the list of improvements. Loses the specific mention of ""commentators and demagogues,"" replacing them with the more general ""leaders."" The phrase ""irreparable damage"" is simplified to just ""hurt,"" which reduces the severity of the warning.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains all four improvements mentioned in the original (longer, healthier, happier, freer). Maintains the book title and author reference clearly. Successfully explains complex terms like ""tribalism"" and ""fatalism"" in simpler language (""think only about their own group and not about the future"").

Weaknesses: Uses some vocabulary that may be challenging for A2 level, such as ""commentators"" and ""humanity."" The phrase ""questioning some important ideas from the past"" is somewhat vague compared to the original's specific mention of attacks on reason and science.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful explanations for complex concepts (defines democracy and international cooperation). Uses very simple sentence structures. Includes all key elements from the original text. The explanatory approach helps A2 learners understand difficult concepts.

Weaknesses: Significantly longer than the original, which may overwhelm A2 readers. Some explanations are unnecessarily detailed for the level. The phrase ""appealing to their emotions and prejudices"" introduces ""prejudices,"" which is a complex concept for A2 level. The length reduces readability despite the simpler vocabulary.

**Overall Assessment:**
Model 2 provides the most balanced approach, maintaining essential information while using appropriate A2-level language. Model 1 offers good simplification but loses some important details. Model 3, while educational, becomes too lengthy and detailed for the target level.

Strengths: Provides the clearest explanation of the cloning process with ""they took small parts from the stems of plants and made new plants."" Maintains the geographical reference to South America. Uses consistent A2-level vocabulary throughout.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""grew and exported most of the bananas"" adds information not present in the original, which stated United Fruit was ""the main grower and exporter"" rather than handling ""most"" bananas.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Preserves the concept of profitability with ""most profitable banana."" Accurately conveys the efficiency aspect with ""very quickly and efficiently."" Maintains the South America reference.

Weaknesses: Uses ""profitable"" which may be challenging for A2 learners compared to simpler alternatives. The phrase ""making copies of the plants"" is less clear than Model 2's explanation of the cloning process. Omits the specific mention that United Fruit was the main company in South America.

This is also bad for the environment because many copies are thrown away on campus and make a mess.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for A2 level. Maintains all key information from the original text. The phrase ""given out free at the university"" effectively simplifies ""distributed free in faculty buildings.""

Weaknesses: ""Learning"" is too vague compared to ""cultural enrichment."" The environmental concern is simplified to just being ""bad for the environment"" without explaining the litter aspect clearly.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains more specific details like ""university buildings"" and ""teaches them about culture."" Clearly explains the environmental problem with ""make a mess."" Uses appropriate A2-level vocabulary while maintaining meaning accuracy.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""This also hurts the environment"" creates a slightly awkward connection between access issues and environmental impact.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very clear, simple language suitable for A2 level. Changes ""staff"" to ""teachers"" which is more concrete for A2 learners. Explains the environmental issue clearly with ""make a mess."" Good use of ""themselves"" to emphasize student production.

Weaknesses: Opens with ""It's free and you can find it"" which uses second person unnecessarily. The transition ""This is also bad"" creates the same logical connection issue as Model 2.

All three translations successfully reduce complexity while maintaining the core message. Model 1 provides the cleanest structure but loses some specificity. Model 2 balances detail retention with simplification effectively. Model 3 uses the most accessible vocabulary but has minor structural issues.

This is higher than the average for our industry, which is 7 out of 100.

About 12 out of 100 employees leave. This might not seem like a lot, but it's more than what other companies in the same industry have. Normally, about 7 out of 100 employees leave. The main goal of this report is to find out why employees like or don't like working at Girox Foods. Then, we want to suggest ways to make the workplace better and to keep more employees from leaving. This is called ""employee retention"". It means we want people to stay and work at Girox Foods for a long time.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level, maintains the key information about percentages and industry comparison, clearly states the report's purpose.
Weaknesses: The phrase ""not happy and engaged"" adds an interpretation not present in the original text, which focused on investigating causes of engagement rather than assuming unhappiness.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Converts percentages to ""out of 100"" format which is clearer for A2 learners, uses simple sentence structures, maintains factual accuracy about the comparison with industry standards.
Weaknesses: Adds the assumption that employees are ""not happy with their jobs"" which wasn't stated in the original, slightly oversimplifies the report's objective.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very simple vocabulary and sentence structures, converts percentages to accessible format, preserves the original caveat about the rate not seeming high initially, provides helpful definition of ""employee retention.""
Weaknesses: Adds explanatory content not in the original text, makes the translation significantly longer than necessary, includes assumptions about employee satisfaction that weren't in the source.

**Comparison:**
All three models successfully simplify the language for A2 level. Model 2 maintains the most factual accuracy while using appropriate simplification techniques. Model 1 provides good simplification but adds interpretive elements. Model 3 offers the most comprehensive explanation but deviates furthest from the original content by adding extensive explanatory material and definitions not present in the source text.

119-a2,"So much of what the speaker said rang true. I honestly believe there's a danger that the more connected we are, the more isolated we feel. I don't think this is such an issue for my generation who've lived without technology for so long. We know how to be alone and, more importantly, we know that it's OK to be alone. But the under 20s are another kettle of fish. They're so busy communicating that they never experience the feeling of solitude and run the risk of not learning how to enjoy their own company. In addition, they're learning conversation through messages that can be edited and changed at the expense of learning the art of real conversation in real time with the person in front of you.",llama-3.3-70b-instruct,"I think the speaker made some good points. The more we're connected, the more alone we might feel. My generation is okay with being alone because we didn't grow up with technology. We know it's fine to be by ourselves. But younger people are different. They're always messaging and never really alone. This means they might not learn to like their own company. Also, they're learning to talk through messages they can edit, instead of having real conversations with people face-to-face.","I think the speaker made some good points. I really believe that the more we're connected to our phones and computers, the more alone we can feel. I don't think this is a big problem for people my age who didn't grow up with technology. We're used to being alone and we know it's okay to have time to ourselves. But for people under 20, it's different. They're always messaging and never really get to experience being alone. This means they might not learn how to be happy with just themselves. Also, they're learning how to talk to people by sending messages that they can change before sending. This means they might not learn how to have real conversations with people face to face.","I think the speaker is right about something. When we are connected to others all the time, we can feel lonely. I don't think this is a big problem for people my age. We didn't have technology when we were young, so we know how to be alone and we think it's okay to be alone. But for people under 20, it's different. They are always sending messages and they don't know what it's like to be alone. This can be a problem because they don't learn how to be happy when they are by themselves. Also, they are learning how to talk to people by sending messages that they can change before they send. This means they don't learn how to have real conversations with people face to face.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for A2 level. Successfully conveys the main ideas about generational differences and technology's impact. The phrase ""younger people are different"" effectively simplifies the original idiom.

Weaknesses: Loses some nuance from the original, particularly the speaker's conviction (""I honestly believe,"" ""rang true""). The connection between constant messaging and inability to enjoy solitude could be clearer.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains more of the original's conviction with ""I really believe."" Provides clear explanations, such as specifying ""phones and computers"" for connectivity. The explanation of message editing is thorough and well-connected to the consequence about real conversations.

Weaknesses: Slightly longer and more complex than typical A2 level. Some phrases like ""get to experience being alone"" may be challenging for A2 learners.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very simple sentence structures suitable for A2 level. Clear cause-and-effect relationships between technology use and social skills. The explanation about message editing and its consequences is straightforward.

Weaknesses: Opens with weaker conviction (""right about something"" vs. the original's stronger agreement). Some repetitive phrasing. The transition between ideas could be smoother.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three translations successfully simplify the vocabulary and grammar for A2 level while preserving the core message about generational differences in technology use and social skills. Model 2 provides the most complete information transfer while remaining accessible. Model 1 offers good simplification but sacrifices some content. Model 3 uses the simplest language but loses some of the original's impact.

120-a2,"Don't always follow positive feedback with negative feedback. When positive and negative feedback always appear to go hand in hand, the positives can become devalued and ignored.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for A2 level. The core message is preserved and easily understood. Sentence structure is straightforward.
Weaknesses: Loses the concept of ""constructive criticism"" entirely. The phrase ""for its own sake"" is omitted, which changes the meaning slightly. Some nuance from the original is lost.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Very simple vocabulary that A2 learners can understand. Maintains the main idea effectively. The phrase ""try not to feel like you have to fix everything"" adds helpful context.
Weaknesses: The language is somewhat informal (""say something bad/good""). Doesn't explain what ""constructive criticism"" means, instead replacing it with simpler terms that may not convey the exact concept.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes an explanation of ""constructive criticism,"" which helps A2 learners understand the concept. Maintains more of the original's meaning and structure. Provides educational value by defining terminology.
Weaknesses: Slightly longer and more complex than typical A2 text. The explanation section makes it less concise. Some sentences could be simplified further.

**Overall Assessment:**
Model 1 provides the clearest, most concise translation but sacrifices some meaning. Model 2 uses very accessible language but loses technical terminology. Model 3 preserves more of the original meaning and provides educational context, though it's slightly more complex.
