Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""losing teeth"" instead of ""teeth falling out""). The sentence structure is clear and straightforward. Successfully simplifies ""insights"" to ""things you didn't know you were thinking about.""

Weaknesses: Changes ""might"" to ""can,"" which slightly alters the tentative tone of the original. The phrase ""being naked in public"" may be too direct for A2 learners who might not know ""naked.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the original tentative tone with ""might."" Keeps the structure close to the original while simplifying vocabulary. Uses ""new ideas"" as a good A2-level replacement for ""insights.""

Weaknesses: Retains ""teeth falling out"" which is more complex than necessary for A2 level. The phrase ""what they really mean"" adds emphasis not present in the original.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides the clearest explanation for the clothing dream with ""having no clothes on when other people can see you,"" which helps A2 learners understand the concept. Uses simple vocabulary throughout.

Weaknesses: Changes ""might"" to ""can,"" altering the original's tentative meaning. The phrase ""losing your teeth"" creates an inconsistent pronoun shift from the general context. ""In your real life"" adds unnecessary emphasis.

**Ranking:**
The translations can be ranked based on their adherence to A2 level vocabulary, clarity for learners, and faithfulness to the original meaning.

**Model 2 Feedback:**

Strengths: Retains the engaging opening that frames the topic as interesting. Uses appropriate A2 vocabulary while maintaining the original's structure. Changes ""packs"" to ""groups"" and ""abandoned"" to ""left behind,"" which are more accessible terms. Preserves the scientific study context well.

Weaknesses: Contains a subject-verb agreement error (""examples...are"" should be ""example...is""). Uses ""seem to understand"" which maintains appropriate uncertainty but could be simplified further.

**Model 3 Feedback:**

Strengths: Keeps the engaging introduction and uses appropriate A2-level vocabulary. Successfully replaces complex terms with simpler alternatives. Maintains good flow and readability while preserving all essential information.

Weaknesses: Contains the same subject-verb agreement error as Model 2 (""examples...are""). Has inconsistent verb tense usage, mixing ""learned"" and ""have learned"" in ways that may confuse A2 learners.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for A2 level. Successfully simplifies ""explosion"" to ""became very popular"" and ""inequality and discrimination"" to ""unfair treatment of people."" The sentence structure is clear and accessible.

Weaknesses: Loses some meaning by oversimplifying ""make political points"" to just ""talk about politics."" The phrase ""just wanted to make beautiful art"" adds an interpretation not present in the original. Some details are omitted, such as the specific mention of adding ""life"" to the walls.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains most of the original meaning while using A2-appropriate vocabulary. ""Big increase"" is a good simplification of ""explosion."" Successfully explains ""discrimination"" as ""treating people badly because they are different."" Keeps the original sentence structure largely intact.

Weaknesses: Uses ""unfairness"" which might be challenging for A2 learners. The explanation of discrimination creates a longer, more complex sentence that may be difficult for the target level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides clear explanations for difficult concepts, including a parenthetical definition of discrimination. Maintains the original meaning well. Uses simple vocabulary in most places and explains complex terms effectively.

Weaknesses: The parenthetical explanation ""(when people are treated badly because they are different)"" creates sentence complexity that exceeds A2 level. Some sentences become longer and more grammatically complex than appropriate for the target level.

**Ranking Analysis:**
Model 1 best achieves A2 simplification through consistently short sentences and simple vocabulary, despite some meaning loss. Model 2 maintains meaning better but uses slightly more complex language.

Weaknesses: ""Built walls around areas"" is less accurate than ""fences"" and may confuse readers about the actual measures taken. Slightly more complex sentence structure in some parts.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains specific reference to guns and includes all key information. Uses simple vocabulary suitable for A2 level. ""Built fences"" accurately reflects the original text.
Weaknesses: Adding ""and mean"" after ""too cruel"" is unnecessary and not present in the original. Some sentences are longer and more complex than needed for A2 level. The phrase ""that says you cannot"" adds unnecessary words.

**Ranking Analysis:**
Model 1 provides the clearest, most concise translation with appropriate A2 simplification. Model 3 maintains accuracy but includes unnecessary additions and slightly more complex structures. Model 2 has the significant inaccuracy of ""walls"" instead of ""fences,"" which changes the meaning of the protective measures described.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""big maze"" instead of ""labyrinth,"" ""gets angry"" for emotional response). The sentence structure is straightforward and accessible.
Weaknesses: Loses some important details like ""inspiration"" becoming just ""comes from"" and omits ""Minos"" entirely. The phrase ""but in the future"" is less precise than the original concept.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains most key information from the original text while using A2-appropriate vocabulary. Preserves the name ""Minos"" and keeps the logical flow with ""Because of this."" Uses ""maze"" instead of the more complex ""labyrinth.""
Weaknesses: The phrase ""must do what Crete says"" could be clearer. Some sentences remain relatively long for A2 level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides clear explanations like ""the city of Athens must do what the city of Crete tells them to do"" and explicitly states the cause-effect relationship with ""Because they fought back."" Maintains all key names and details.
Weaknesses: Contains longer, more complex sentences that may challenge A2 readers. The explanation of the Athens-Crete relationship, while clear, adds length that might overwhelm beginners.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three models successfully simplify vocabulary and maintain the core narrative. Model 1 achieves the greatest simplification but sacrifices some content accuracy. Model 2 balances simplification with content retention effectively. Model 3 provides the most complete information but with increased complexity that may challenge A2 learners.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for A2 level. Successfully simplifies ""conservation issues"" to ""protecting animals and their homes in nature."" Maintains the core meaning while reducing complexity.

Weaknesses: Loses the inspirational aspect mentioned in the original text. The phrase ""how to help sick animals"" is less precise than ""how to treat illnesses."" Some nuance is lost in the simplification process.

**Model 2 Feedback:**
Strengths: Retains the inspirational element with ""make people want to protect animals."" Uses accessible vocabulary while maintaining more of the original meaning. The phrase ""how to help sick animals get better"" is clearer than Model 1's version.

Weaknesses: The opening phrase ""By bringing people and animals together"" may be slightly complex for A2 level. Could benefit from shorter, more direct sentences.

**Model 3 Feedback:**
Strengths: Uses very simple sentence structures with clear subject-verb patterns. Separates ideas into distinct sentences, making it easier to follow. Includes the motivational aspect with ""make people want to help save animals."" The phrase ""how to help sick animals get better"" is clear and appropriate.

Weaknesses: The repetition of ""people"" in ""animals that people hurt in circuses or animals that people left behind"" creates awkward phrasing. The separation of ideas sometimes creates choppy flow.

All three models successfully reduce vocabulary complexity and sentence length for A2 level. Model 2 maintains the best balance between simplification and meaning retention.

Strengths: Maintains good flow while using A2-appropriate vocabulary. Preserves the original structure reasonably well. Uses ""complete power"" which is simpler than ""absolute power."" The sentence combining works effectively.

Weaknesses: Uses ""areas"" consistently instead of ""districts,"" which loses some of the original terminology. The passive voice in ""were destroyed"" at the end is somewhat abrupt.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Balances simple vocabulary with natural sentence flow. Maintains the term ""districts"" which preserves the original meaning. Provides clear explanation of the Capitol's role. The final sentence clearly shows cause and effect.

Strengths: Uses very simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for A2 level. The core concept is clearly communicated. Grammar is straightforward and accessible.
Weaknesses: Oversimplifies ""underutilised items"" to just ""things people don't use very much,"" losing some meaning. Omits the profit-generation aspect entirely. The phrase ""old things"" is less precise than ""second-hand goods.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains more of the original meaning, including the profit-making aspect. Uses ""unused things"" and ""used goods"" which better reflect the original terminology. Preserves the concept of online communities generating profit.
Weaknesses: ""When the internet started"" is a slight mistranslation of ""with the advent of the internet."" Some sentences could be shorter for A2 level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes the profit-making concept from the original. Uses clear, simple language. Maintains the key ideas while simplifying appropriately. The phrase ""We call this"" adds a personal touch that works well for A2.
Weaknesses: ""When the internet started"" misinterprets the original phrase. Uses ""old things"" instead of more accurate terms like ""used goods."" Some repetition in describing unused items.

**Ranking Analysis:**
Model 2 preserves the most essential meaning while maintaining A2-appropriate language. It includes the crucial profit element and uses more accurate terminology.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""1700s and 1800s,"" ""random pictures""). The sentence structure is clear and accessible. Successfully maintains the main concepts while simplifying language.

Weaknesses: Loses some precision by omitting ""conscious mind"" entirely and replacing it with ""things we don't know about ourselves."" The explanation of brain activity is somewhat oversimplified, potentially losing meaning.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful context by explaining ""200-300 years ago"" and adding ""(a famous doctor who studied the mind)"" for Freud. Maintains more of the original meaning, including ""conscious mind"" concept through ""hidden in our mind."" Uses appropriate A2 vocabulary while preserving content accuracy.

Weaknesses: Slightly longer sentences that may challenge A2 readers. The phrase ""mix of random things happening"" is somewhat awkward.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains the original time reference while making it accessible. Provides context about Freud being ""a famous doctor."" Maintains good balance between simplification and accuracy. Clear sentence structure throughout.

Weaknesses: Some sentences could be shorter for A2 level. The phrase ""random pictures and feelings"" appears twice, creating slight repetition.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for A2 level. Maintains the core meaning while simplifying complex phrases effectively. The flow is natural and easy to follow.

Weaknesses: Omits ""freelancer"" terminology entirely, which removes important context. ""Quiet office"" is an inaccurate interpretation - the original doesn't mention quietness specifically.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes helpful clarification ""don't have a boss"" which aids A2 comprehension. Preserves most original details including ""coffee shop near my house"" and ""putting on work clothes."" Uses appropriate A2 vocabulary throughout.

Weaknesses: ""Think clearly about my work"" is slightly more complex than necessary for A2 level. Some phrases like ""took my attention away"" could be simpler.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Clear explanation ""I am my own boss"" helps A2 learners understand the concept. Maintains good detail preservation and uses simple sentence structures effectively.

Weaknesses: ""I had to clean the house, I wanted to drink tea"" changes the meaning - the original presents these as distractions, not obligations or desires. This creates factual inaccuracy about the source of distraction.

This causes more money problems and harm to the environment.",People might not know they are part of the throw-away clothing problem because they give their old clothes to charity shops. But charity shops cannot sell all those old clothes. 'Fast fashion' means cheap clothes that become old-fashioned very quickly. These clothes are often bad quality and cannot be used again. People do not want to buy them in second-hand shops. Very large amounts of these clothes go in the trash. Many clothes that charity shops cannot sell go to other countries. This causes more money problems and environmental problems. Environmental problems means problems for nature and the world around us.,"**Model 1 Analysis:**

Strengths:
- Maintains clear sentence structure appropriate for A2 level
- Uses simple vocabulary replacements (""old clothes"" for ""unwanted clothes"")
- Preserves the main ideas from the original text
- Good flow between sentences

Weaknesses:
- ""Old-fashioned"" may be slightly advanced for A2 learners
- Doesn't explain what ""fast fashion"" means
- ""Economy and environment"" could be simplified further

**Model 2 Analysis:**

Strengths:
- Provides helpful explanation of ""fast fashion"" as ""cheap clothes that go out of style very quickly""
- Uses very simple vocabulary (""trash"" instead of ""thrown away"")
- Breaks down complex concepts into easier terms
- Good use of ""money problems"" instead of ""economic problems""

Weaknesses:
- ""Go out of style"" might still be challenging for A2 level
- Some sentences are quite long for the target level
- ""Harm to the environment"" could be more specific

**Model 3 Analysis:**

Strengths:
- Provides clear definition of ""fast fashion""
- Includes helpful explanation of environmental problems at the end
- Uses very simple vocabulary throughout
- Breaks information into shorter, clearer sentences
- ""Money problems"" is more accessible than ""economic problems""

Weaknesses:
- The added explanation at the end feels somewhat disconnected
- Some repetition that could be streamlined
- Slightly longer overall, which may challenge A2 readers

All three models successfully adapt the text for A2 level by simplifying vocabulary and sentence structure. Model 2 provides the best balance of clarity and explanation without being overly lengthy. Model 3 offers good explanations but becomes somewhat verbose. Model 1 maintains good flow but lacks explanatory context for key terms.

Strengths: Uses very simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for A2 level. The message is clear and direct.
Weaknesses: Loses some important details from the original text, such as ""his home city"" and ""to encourage residents."" The simplification removes context about encouraging specific people (residents) to think about the issue.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains most of the original meaning while using A2-appropriate vocabulary. Successfully replaces ""homeless people"" with ""people who have no homes"" and ""residents"" with ""people living there."" Preserves the encouraging aspect of the artist's work.
Weaknesses: The phrase ""problems in society"" is slightly less natural than ""social problems,"" though still understandable.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Keeps the reference to Paris as ""his home city"" and uses simple vocabulary throughout. Attempts to explain homelessness in very basic terms.
Weaknesses: The final phrase ""when people have no place to live"" is unnecessarily wordy and awkward. Contains a grammatical inconsistency with ""people who have no home"" (singular ""home"" for plural ""people""). The sentence structure becomes convoluted in the attempt to oversimplify.

Strengths: Uses simple sentence structures appropriate for A2 level. Vocabulary is accessible with ""local governments"" and ""special areas."" Information is presented clearly.
Weaknesses: The sentence ""They don't want artists to paint graffiti anywhere on walls"" oversimplifies the original meaning and loses the concept of ""randomly."" The connection between discouraging random graffiti and providing designated areas is unclear.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the original meaning more accurately with ""not to paint graffiti anywhere they want."" Preserves the logical flow of the original text. Uses ""underground trains"" which is appropriate vocabulary for A2.
Weaknesses: Contains a very long sentence that may be challenging for A2 readers: ""In some places, local governments have tried to help artists not to paint graffiti anywhere they want on walls by letting them work in special areas.""

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Breaks down complex ideas into shorter, clearer sentences suitable for A2 level. The sentence structure is consistently simple.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for A2 level. Successfully simplifies ""pavements"" to ""streets"" and ""abandoned cars"" to ""old cars."" The final sentence about life cycles is clear and concise.

Weaknesses: Loses the meaning of ""explore different locations"" by changing it to ""in different places,"" which alters the sense that she actively seeks out locations. ""Rain and city workers clean it away"" is slightly awkward phrasing.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains most of the original meaning while using A2-appropriate vocabulary. Successfully explains ""abandoned cars"" as ""old cars that nobody uses."" The phrase ""always changing"" effectively captures the original concept. Preserves the connection between temporary art and life's cycles well.

Weaknesses: Slightly longer sentences that may be at the upper limit of A2 complexity. The phrase ""washed away by rain"" introduces a verb form that wasn't in the original.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very clear, simple language appropriate for A2 level. The explanation ""old cars that people don't use anymore"" is particularly clear. Adds ""wind"" as an additional weather element, which enhances understanding. The final message about life changes is well-expressed.

Weaknesses: The contraction ""doesn't"" may be less formal than expected in some A2 contexts. Adding ""wind"" changes the original content slightly, though it aids comprehension.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for A2 level. Successfully conveys the main contrast between the two workplace cultures. The comparison ""like teachers"" is clear and relatable.

Weaknesses: Loses some important details from the original, such as the concept that ""everyone has their rightful place."" The phrase ""ask questions"" is somewhat vague compared to the original's ""expect to be challenged.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains more detail from the original text, including ""Everyone knew their place"" and ""give different ideas."" Uses accessible vocabulary while preserving key concepts. The explanation of leaders as ""teachers or helpers"" is clear.

Weaknesses: Slightly longer sentences that may approach the upper limit of A2 complexity. Some phrases like ""find answers"" could be more specific to decision-making contexts.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for A2 level. Maintains the core information about the brothers and their work.
Weaknesses: Omits ""identical"" which is important context. ""Special machines"" is vague compared to the original ""cranes."" Loses the range aspect by saying ""small tags and big pictures"" rather than ""everything from tags to huge pictures.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes the identical twin concept with ""exactly the same."" Captures the range of their work with ""many things - from small writing to very big pictures."" Uses ""special tall machines"" which gives more context than Model 1's ""special machines.""
Weaknesses: Still avoids the word ""cranes"" which could be learned vocabulary. ""Bright"" instead of ""colourful"" is a minor change but acceptable.

Weaknesses: Loses some specificity by changing ""throughout history"" to ""always"" and ""prehistoric times"" to ""long ago."" The phrase ""People also wrote on walls in old places"" creates ambiguity about whether this refers to the same cave paintings or different locations.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains temporal specificity with ""for a very long time"" and ""long, long ago."" Provides helpful explanations like ""scientists who study old things"" for archaeologists and ""an old language"" for Latin. Preserves the distinction between different historical periods.

Weaknesses: Uses ""magic words"" instead of ""magic spells,"" which changes the meaning slightly. The phrase ""long, long ago"" may be overly simplified even for A2 level.

Weaknesses: Uses the vague pronoun ""they"" without clearly identifying who is conducting the test, combines too much information in single sentences which may be challenging for A2 level, and ""push it out of its path"" could be ambiguous.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Clearly identifies ""scientists"" as the actors, retains ""Didymoon"" with proper context, uses ""space rock"" for simplification, breaks information into appropriately short sentences, and provides clear cause-and-effect relationships.
Weaknesses: Minor redundancy in sentence structure, and could have been more specific about the type of change telescopes will observe.

**Ranking Analysis:**
Model 3 provides the clearest subject identification and best sentence structure for A2 learners. Model 1 offers good simplification but loses important details. Model 2 retains key information but has clarity issues with pronoun usage and sentence complexity.

Soon Katniss has difficult feelings about Peeta and their relationship becomes complicated.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple sentence structures and basic vocabulary appropriate for A2 level. Successfully simplifies ""heroine"" to ""main character"" and ""skilful"" to ""very good."" The phrase ""says she will go instead"" clearly conveys volunteering.
Weaknesses: ""Difficult feelings about him"" is vague and loses the specific meaning of ""complicated relationship."" Doesn't mention the games context, which may confuse readers unfamiliar with the story.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains simple vocabulary while adding helpful context like ""fight in the games"" and ""accident at work in the mines."" Uses clear, direct language throughout. The phrase ""picked to fight in the games"" provides better context than other versions.
Weaknesses: ""Difficult feelings about him"" remains vague. The ending feels abrupt and doesn't fully capture the relationship complexity mentioned in the original.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides good context with ""picked to be in the games"" and explains the mining accident clearly. Uses simple vocabulary consistently. Attempts to preserve the original's ending about complicated relationships by including both ""difficult feelings"" and ""relationship becomes complicated.""
Weaknesses: The final sentence becomes slightly more complex with multiple clauses, which may challenge A2 readers. Some redundancy in explaining Katniss will go ""instead of her sister"" when this was already clear.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three models successfully simplify vocabulary and sentence structure for A2 level. Model 2 provides the clearest context about the games setting. Model 3 makes the strongest attempt to preserve the original's meaning about the complicated relationship. Model 1 is the most concise but loses some important context.

Strengths: Uses simple sentence structures and basic vocabulary appropriate for A2 level. The phrase ""things that happen in your real life"" is clear and accessible.
Weaknesses: Loses some meaning by omitting the concept that people and places ""add to the meaning."" The connection between dream analysis and meaning interpretation is not clearly maintained.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the original meaning well, including the important concept that people and places help with ""understanding what the dream means."" Preserves the logical flow of the original text.
Weaknesses: Contains more complex structures like ""they might be important for understanding what the dream means"" which may be challenging for A2 learners. The sentence length and subordinate clauses exceed typical A2 complexity.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple conditional structure ""If you write about your dreams"" which is clear for A2 level. Explicitly states that people and places ""can help you understand what the dream means."" Adds ""every day"" for clarity about daily life connections.
Weaknesses: Slightly longer than necessary for A2 level. The phrase ""how you feel every day"" adds information not present in the original text.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level. Maintains the core meaning while simplifying sentence structure effectively. The phrase ""burn down completely"" accurately conveys the original meaning.

Weaknesses: Uses ""steel wheels on steel tracks"" which may be slightly advanced vocabulary for A2 level. The connection between sparks and fire could be clearer.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Simplifies vocabulary by using ""metal"" instead of ""steel,"" which is more appropriate for A2 level. Maintains clear cause-and-effect relationship between sparks and fires. Good sentence flow and readability.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""start burning and burn down completely"" is somewhat redundant and could be more concise.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very simple sentence structures with clear subject-verb-object patterns ideal for A2 learners. Breaks down complex ideas into digestible steps. Uses basic vocabulary throughout. Explicitly explains the cause-and-effect chain, making it very clear for beginners.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for A2 level. Successfully simplifies complex phrases like ""legitimate art form"" to ""real art."" The sentence structure is clear and accessible.

Weaknesses: Omits ""neighbourhood"" from the original text. Changes ""share photos"" to ""show photos"" which slightly alters meaning. The phrase ""some new things happening"" is somewhat vague compared to ""certain trends are emerging.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains most of the original content including ""neighbourhood"" (expressed as ""area where they live""). Uses A2-appropriate vocabulary while preserving the meaning. Successfully adapts ""legitimate art form"" to ""real art."" Includes ""all over the world"" which captures the global scope.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""share pictures"" changes ""photos"" to ""pictures"" unnecessarily. Some sentences are slightly longer than typical A2 level, though still comprehensible.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Preserves the original meaning well with appropriate A2 vocabulary. Includes the neighbourhood concept as ""area where they live."" Maintains the structure and flow of the original text effectively.

Weaknesses: Uses ""show photos"" instead of ""share photos,"" which changes the collaborative aspect to a more one-way display. The phrase ""people in the art world"" is slightly more complex than necessary for A2 level.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and sentence structures appropriate for A2 level. Breaks down complex ideas into shorter, clearer sentences. The phrase ""does not like watching"" is more concrete than ""found upsetting.""

Weaknesses: Loses the meaning of ""always"" from the original. Changes ""frightening experience"" to just ""scared,"" which slightly reduces the impact. The translation is somewhat oversimplified.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the original sentence structure while making vocabulary more accessible with ""sad and scary"" instead of ""upsetting."" Preserves the meaning of ""always"" and keeps ""frightening"" which maintains the emotional impact.

Weaknesses: Retains more complex sentence structures that may be challenging for A2 learners. Some phrases like ""tried to keep her safe"" could be simplified further.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""very hungry, sick and tired,"" ""don't die""). The sentence structure is straightforward and accessible. Successfully conveys the main plot points.

Weaknesses: Changes ""lifeboat"" to just ""lifeboat"" but loses some specificity. ""I don't want to tell you"" shifts the narrative voice inappropriately from third person to first person. ""Big storms"" is less precise than the original ""violent storms.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains appropriate A2 vocabulary while preserving more original meaning. Keeps ""Pacific Ocean"" which adds geographical context. ""Small boat"" effectively simplifies ""lifeboat."" Maintains third-person narrative voice consistently. ""It would be wrong to tell you"" preserves the original tone better.

Weaknesses: ""Go through being very hungry"" is slightly awkward phrasing. The phrase ""far away"" is added unnecessarily when describing the coast.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains ""lifeboat"" from the original text. Uses simple, clear vocabulary appropriate for A2 level. ""Go through terrible storms"" effectively conveys the severity. Maintains third-person narrative voice.

Weaknesses: ""They don't die"" is overly simplistic compared to ""they stay alive"" or ""they survive."" ""It would be bad to tell you"" is less natural than other options. Repeats ""they can see land"" instead of varying the expression as in the original.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains better narrative flow while keeping language accessible. Retains more original phrasing like ""made herself a cup of coffee."" Preserves the detail about the father's preference for jazz music. Uses appropriate A2-level vocabulary substitutions like ""favorite"" for ""beloved.""

Weaknesses: Keeps some slightly more complex sentence structures that might challenge A2 learners. The phrase ""became noisy"" uses a more advanced grammatical construction.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses clear, simple sentence structures throughout. Effectively breaks down complex sentences while maintaining logical flow. Uses appropriate A2 vocabulary like ""made"" instead of ""cooked"" for dinner preparation.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""coffee for herself"" sounds less natural than other alternatives. Uses ""would be noisy"" which introduces conditional tense that may be challenging for A2 level. Omits the ""beloved/favorite"" detail about the jazz music.

All three models successfully preserve the main story elements and adapt the vocabulary to A2 level.

Strengths: Uses very simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for A2 level. Successfully simplifies ""planetary defence team"" to just ""NASA found"" and ""significant danger"" to ""dangerous.""

Weaknesses: Changes ""Earth's orbit"" to just ""Earth,"" which loses important meaning. The phrase ""thinks about 50 more exist"" is less precise than the original ""estimated 50 left to log."" Some sentence structures could be clearer.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains most of the original meaning accurately. Explains ""Earth's orbit"" as ""Earth's path around the sun,"" which is helpful for A2 learners. Preserves the concept of ""planetary defence team"" in simple terms. Uses ""serious danger"" which maintains the original tone.

Weaknesses: Contains some complex structures like ""With about 50 more to find and record"" that may challenge A2 readers. The sentence length varies significantly, with some sentences being quite long for the target level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and maintains accuracy. Explains ""Earth's orbit"" clearly as ""Earth's path around the sun."" Breaks information into shorter, more digestible sentences. Successfully simplifies ""estimated 50 left to log"" to ""thinks there are about 50 more to find.""

Weaknesses: The sentence ""They include anything within 50 million kilometres of Earth's path around the sun"" could be clearer about what ""they"" refers to. Minor loss of nuance by changing ""significant danger"" to just ""dangerous.""

**Ranking Analysis:**
Model 3 provides the best balance of simplicity and accuracy for A2 level. Model 2 maintains high accuracy but uses more complex structures. Model 1 oversimplifies to the point of losing some important meaning.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for A2 level. Successfully simplifies complex phrases like ""agonising experience"" to ""much harder for him."" Maintains the story's flow and includes all key plot points. The vocabulary choices are consistently accessible.

Weaknesses: Loses some emotional impact from the original. ""School trip"" instead of ""school camp"" is less specific. The phrase ""they think they will get sick"" oversimplifies the plague reference.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains more of the original structure and phrasing while making necessary simplifications. Keeps ""school camp"" and attempts to explain ""the plague"" concept. Maintains stronger emotional language with ""very painful experience.""

Weaknesses: Contains grammatical errors (""difficult good and bad times"" is confusing). The explanation ""(a made-up sickness)"" adds complexity that may not be suitable for A2 level. Some phrases remain too complex for the target level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and sentence structures. Successfully simplifies most complex concepts. Maintains the basic narrative structure and includes key story elements.

Weaknesses: Contains an awkward phrase ""he has to go on his first day"" which is unclear. Loses the specific reference to ""the plague"" entirely, which removes important context. ""Something bad and surprising"" is less precise than the original's meaning.

All three translations successfully reduce vocabulary complexity and sentence length for A2 level readers. Model 1 provides the most consistent simplification while maintaining clarity. Model 2 attempts to preserve more original elements but creates confusion with mixed complexity levels. Model 3 oversimplifies some important details and contains unclear phrasing.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and sentence structures appropriate for A2 level. Maintains the core meaning of the original text. The phrase ""went on and on, very far"" effectively conveys the vastness.

Weaknesses: ""Could not see the fences clearly"" changes the meaning - the original suggests the fences are barely visible due to distance, not clarity. The transition between ideas could be smoother.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Preserves the original meaning most accurately, including the conditional nature of the teenage boy scenario (""might get bored""). Uses appropriate A2 vocabulary while maintaining narrative flow. ""Hard to see"" better captures the original meaning than ""not clearly.""

Weaknesses: Slightly more complex sentence structures in some places, though still within A2 range.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Very clear and simple language structure. Breaks down complex ideas into shorter sentences. Uses direct speech format for Sam's thoughts, which can aid comprehension.

Weaknesses: Changes the narrative style by converting indirect thought to direct speech with quotation marks, altering the original's tone. ""There could be many problems if someone who could ride well tried to escape"" misrepresents the original meaning - it should indicate that a good rider could cause trouble, not necessarily face problems. The repetitive sentence structure becomes somewhat mechanical.

**Ranking Analysis:**
Model 2 maintains the best balance between A2 accessibility and faithfulness to the original meaning and tone. Model 1 provides good simplification but has some meaning changes. Model 3, while very simple, makes significant structural changes and contains meaning distortions.

Strengths:
- Uses simple, clear vocabulary appropriate for A2 level
- Breaks down complex sentences into shorter, manageable ones
- Maintains all key information from the original text
- Uses basic connectors like ""because"" and ""but""

Weaknesses:
- Slightly choppy sentence structure due to over-simplification
- ""After school"" could be misunderstood as referring to daily school rather than completing education

**Model 2 Analysis:**

Strengths:
- Maintains good flow while simplifying language
- Preserves the original sentence structure where possible
- Uses appropriate A2 vocabulary like ""reached,"" ""tall mountains,"" ""very cold weather""
- ""When she finished school"" clearly indicates completion of education
- Keeps the phrase ""look for new things to do"" which maintains the original meaning well

Weaknesses:
- ""Even though"" might be slightly advanced for A2 level
- Could have simplified ""continued climbing mountains"" further

**Model 3 Analysis:**

Strengths:
- Uses very simple vocabulary and sentence structures
- Clearly explains concepts with phrases like ""new difficult things to do""
- Good use of basic connectors
- ""When she was not working"" is very clear for A2 learners

Weaknesses:
- Adds ""But"" at the beginning of a sentence unnecessarily, creating slight awkwardness
- Repetitive use of ""climbing mountains"" 
- Slightly more verbose than needed for A2 level
- The flow is somewhat disrupted by the extra ""But"" connector

All three models successfully convey the main information and use vocabulary appropriate for A2 level. Model 2 maintains the best balance between simplification and natural flow, while Model 1 provides clear communication despite some choppiness, and Model 3, while clear, has some structural issues that affect readability.

Strengths: Uses simple sentence structures appropriate for A2 level. Clearly explains the charity's purpose with ""children who don't have parents."" Maintains factual accuracy throughout.

Weaknesses: Uses ""hurt your brain and body"" which shifts to second person unexpectedly. The phrase ""not much oxygen"" is less precise than the original's meaning about oxygen levels affecting functioning.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains third person consistently. Includes helpful clarification ""extra oxygen to help her breathe."" Preserves the specific meaning about brain and body functioning. Uses parentheses effectively to include the 8,000-meter detail.

Weaknesses: Contains more complex sentence structures that may challenge A2 learners. The parenthetical information creates longer, more demanding sentences.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses consistently simple sentence structures. Breaks information into digestible chunks with short sentences. Maintains third person throughout. Uses ""very little air"" which is more accessible than ""oxygen levels.""

Weaknesses: Separates related information across multiple sentences, which may fragment the meaning. The phrase ""very little air"" is less scientifically accurate than discussing oxygen specifically.

**Ranking Assessment:**
Model 2 preserves meaning most accurately while remaining accessible, though it uses slightly more complex structures. Model 3 achieves the best sentence simplicity for A2 level but sacrifices some precision. Model 1 falls between the others but has the point-of-view inconsistency issue.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for A2 level. Successfully simplifies ""tropical country"" to ""hot country"" and ""guest room"" to ""extra room.""
Weaknesses: Loses some meaning by omitting ""in our lives"" and ""at some point."" The phrase ""place to keep old things"" changes the meaning from a general storage room to specifically old items storage.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains more of the original meaning by including ""in our lives."" Uses clear A2-appropriate vocabulary. Specifies ""Saturday and Sunday"" instead of ""weekends"" which is more concrete for A2 learners.
Weaknesses: The phrase ""even though we live in a hot country"" is slightly more complex grammatically than necessary for A2. ""Stopped using"" is a good simplification but slightly changes the nuance from ""put away.""

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains ""in our lives"" from the original. Uses ""put away"" which maintains the original meaning better than ""stopped using."" The relative clause ""where we keep old things"" is grammatically appropriate for A2.
Weaknesses: Similar to Model 2, maintains slightly more complex sentence structures. The conjunction ""but"" creates a shorter, choppier sentence structure compared to the original flow.

All three models successfully reduce vocabulary complexity and sentence length for A2 level. They appropriately simplify ""woollen"" to ""warm,"" ""trendy"" to ""good/nice,"" and ""tropical"" to ""hot."" Each model handles the smartphone example well by using ""old phone"" and ""new one.""

Strengths:
- Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level
- Maintains clear, short sentences
- Successfully simplifies ""mountain gorges"" to ""mountains""
- Converts ""subject to intense scrutiny"" to ""people watch them carefully""

Weaknesses:
- Loses meaning by changing ""involved building bridges"" to ""are bridges""
- ""Building work"" is too vague compared to ""civil engineering""
- Does not explain what ""civil engineering"" means
- ""Fall down"" is less precise than ""collapse""

**Model 2 Analysis:**

Strengths: Uses simple sentence structures and basic vocabulary appropriate for A2 level. Breaks down complex ideas into shorter sentences. Clearly explains the manager's questions by putting them in quotation marks.
Weaknesses: Changes ""after weeks of frustration"" to ""had problems for many weeks,"" which alters the temporal flow. The phrase ""answer was not clear enough"" is slightly inaccurate since the manager asked questions rather than gave answers.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the original temporal structure with ""After weeks of."" Uses A2-appropriate vocabulary like ""angry and upset"" to explain frustration. Preserves the meaning that the manager ""only asked"" questions.
Weaknesses: Uses ""feeling angry and upset"" which may be slightly more complex than necessary for A2. The phrase ""didn't feel like he was dealing with the problem"" uses a more advanced construction.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""groups"" instead of ""packs,"" ""city trains"" instead of ""metro system""). The sentence structure is clear and accessible. Successfully maintains the core meaning while simplifying complex terms.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""good sense of smell"" is less precise than the original ""excellent sense of smell."" The final sentence structure becomes slightly awkward with ""so local people don't really notice them anymore.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains more precision from the original text with ""underground trains"" and ""very good sense of smell."" The explanation of announcements is clearer with ""when someone speaks on the train."" The final sentence better captures the original meaning about dogs traveling unnoticed.

Weaknesses: Uses ""prettier"" instead of ""cute,"" which changes the meaning slightly. ""Underground trains"" may be less familiar to A2 learners than simpler alternatives.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very simple vocabulary with ""people"" instead of ""humans"" and ""very good nose"" instead of ""sense of smell."" The sentence structures are straightforward and easy to follow.

Weaknesses: ""Very good nose"" is overly simplified and may sound unnatural. The final sentence has redundant phrasing with both ""people on the trains"" and ""local people,"" making it less clear than the original.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three models successfully adapt the text to A2 level by simplifying vocabulary and sentence structures. Model 2 maintains the best balance between simplification and accuracy. Model 1 provides good simplification but has some awkward phrasing. Model 3 oversimplifies certain elements, making some phrases sound unnatural.

Strengths: Uses very simple sentence structures and basic vocabulary appropriate for A2 level. Maintains factual accuracy and covers all key information points.
Weaknesses: Oversimplifies ""stream"" to ""river"" which changes the meaning slightly. The phrase ""nothing worse than"" is reduced to just mentioning bites without conveying that these were minor compared to potential dangers.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains most original details while simplifying language. Good explanation of ""river's mouth"" as ""where the river meets the sea."" Maintains the contrast between danger and minor injuries.
Weaknesses: Uses ""dangerous snakes that can kill you"" which adds interpretation not in the original. ""Thousands of mosquito and ant bites"" becomes ""thousands of...bites"" losing the ""few"" qualifier from the original.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and sentence structures suitable for A2. Clearly explains ""river's mouth"" concept. Maintains the contrast between potential and actual harm with ""nothing really bad happened.""
Weaknesses: Changes ""stream"" to ""river"" like Model 1. The phrase ""many bites"" loses the specific ""few thousand"" quantification. Adds ""like"" before listing animals, which slightly changes the structure.

**Ranking Assessment:**
Model 2 maintains the most accuracy while achieving appropriate simplification. Model 3 provides good clarity but makes more content changes. Model 1 is the most simplified but loses some nuance and detail.

Strengths:
- Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level
- Maintains clear sentence structure
- Preserves key numerical data accurately
- Successfully simplifies ""landfill sites"" to ""big holes in the ground""

Weaknesses:
- Omits ""per adult"" specification for the £670 debt figure
- Loses the 66% calculation connecting debt to wardrobe spending
- Removes the phrase ""average person"" which provides important context
- Simplifies ""landfill sites"" perhaps too much, losing the specific term

**Model 2 Analysis:**

Strengths:
- Retains ""average person"" from the original text
- Includes helpful parenthetical explanations for technical terms
- Preserves the 66% calculation and ""per adult"" specification
- Maintains the conditional phrase ""That might not sound like a lot""
- Provides clear definitions without oversimplifying

Weaknesses:
- Slightly longer explanations may challenge A2 readers
- Uses ""owe...per adult"" which could be confusing for A2 level

**Model 3 Analysis:**

Strengths:
- Adds helpful explanation ""This means they borrow money to buy clothes""
- Provides detailed explanation of landfill sites
- Maintains most numerical accuracy including the 66% figure
- Uses clear, simple language throughout

Weaknesses:
- Omits ""per adult"" from the debt figure
- Removes ""average person"" context
- The landfill explanation is somewhat lengthy for A2 level
- Changes ""they don't need"" to ""they don't really need,"" adding unnecessary complexity

All three models successfully reduce complexity while maintaining the core message. Model 2 best balances simplification with accuracy, retaining important details while providing necessary explanations. Model 3 offers good explanations but loses some precision. Model 1 achieves the greatest simplification but sacrifices too much detail.

In the wild, some of the rarest species have difficulty in finding mates and breeding, and they might also be threatened by poachers, loss of their habitat and predators. A good zoo will enable these species to live and breed in a secure environment. In addition, as numbers of some wild species drop, there is an increased danger of populations becoming too genetically similar.

Strengths: Uses very simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""have babies"" instead of ""breed,"" ""bad people"" for ""poachers""). The sentence structure is straightforward and accessible. Successfully conveys the main concepts of breeding programs and genetic diversity in simple terms.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""disappear forever"" is somewhat informal for the context. The explanation of genetic diversity as ""more different from each other"" is overly simplified and could be clearer.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains simple vocabulary while being slightly more precise (""hunt them illegally"" for poachers). Preserves more of the original structure while keeping it accessible. The term ""baby-making programs"" directly translates the concept for A2 learners.

Weaknesses: Some phrases like ""other animals that want to eat them"" anthropomorphizes predators unnecessarily. The text is slightly longer, which may challenge A2 readers.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides clear explanations with simple vocabulary. Adds helpful clarification (""This is not good for the animals"") that aids comprehension. The flow between sentences is logical and easy to follow.

Weaknesses: Slightly more complex sentence structures in some parts. The repetition of ""animals"" throughout makes the text somewhat monotonous. Some sentences could be shorter for A2 level.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""very rare,"" ""hit,"" ""heavy,"" ""breaking""). The sentence structure is clear and concise. Successfully simplifies complex concepts like ""velocity of impact"" to ""hit the bridge very fast.""

Weaknesses: Loses some specificity from the original text. ""New technology can find problems in bridges"" is less precise than the original's ""detect structural weakness."" The phrase ""safer work places"" doesn't clearly connect to bridge safety context.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains more detail from the original while keeping A2-appropriate language. ""How fast they hit the bridge"" effectively explains velocity of impact. Preserves the word ""terrible"" from the original text. Better explains the planning aspect with ""plan for these problems.""

Weaknesses: Some repetitive phrasing with ""make it fall down"" used multiple times. The sentence ""even if they are moving very slowly when it happens"" maintains awkward phrasing from the original.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides the most complete translation while maintaining A2 accessibility. ""Do not happen very often"" is clear and natural. ""Plan for problems before they happen"" adds helpful clarification. ""Better ways to build bridges"" effectively simplifies ""better designs."" ""Safer places for workers"" clearly indicates the work environment context.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""puts together,"" ""special meanings,"" ""talking to ourselves""). The sentence structure is clear and accessible. Successfully simplifies ""symbolic meaning"" to ""special meanings.""

Weaknesses: Changes ""they appear in dreams"" to ""in dreams these thoughts,"" which slightly alters the meaning. Uses ""happen when"" instead of preserving the causal relationship more clearly.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains closer fidelity to the original text structure and meaning. Preserves ""during the day"" and ""show up in dreams"" which better reflects the original phrasing. Uses appropriate A2 vocabulary while keeping the logical flow intact.

Weaknesses: Slightly more complex sentence structure in the first sentence with ""because our mind puts together."" The phrase ""come to our minds"" might be marginally more complex than necessary for A2.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very simple vocabulary and sentence structures. The phrase ""like words in our head"" is particularly clear for A2 learners. Maintains the essential meaning while simplifying effectively.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""our thoughts are mostly like words in our head"" changes the meaning from the original ""thoughts appear as words"" to suggesting thoughts resemble words. This creates a conceptual inaccuracy.

**Ranking:**
[""model_2"", ""model_1"", ""model_3""]

Model 2 maintains the best balance between A2 accessibility and fidelity to the original meaning. Model 1 provides good simplification but with minor meaning changes. Model 3, while simple, introduces a conceptual distortion that affects comprehension of the original idea."

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for A2 level. Successfully simplifies complex concepts like ""self-disclosure"" by removing the term entirely. Maintains the core message about relationship importance.

Weaknesses: Loses the specific mention of ""most happy people"" from the study, which changes the precision of the research finding. Omits the technical term ""self-disclosure"" completely, which removes educational value.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains the technical term ""self-disclosure"" with a clear explanation in parentheses. Maintains most of the original structure while simplifying language. Preserves the study reference accurately.

Weaknesses: The parenthetical explanation may be slightly complex for A2 learners. Some sentences remain relatively long for the target level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Adds helpful context by mentioning ""Scientists did a study"" which aids comprehension. Provides the most thorough explanation of ""self-disclosure"" with additional context about trust. Uses very clear, simple language throughout.

Weaknesses: Adds information not present in the original text (""scientists,"" ""someone you trust""). Makes the text longer than necessary for A2 level. Some explanations become repetitive.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for A2 level. Successfully conveys the main concept about brain plasticity and the importance of praising process over results. The contrast between ineffective and effective praise is clear.

Weaknesses: Omits the ""growth mindset"" concept entirely, which is a key term from the original. The phrase ""test new ideas"" is less accurate than ""experimentation."" Some nuance is lost in the simplification.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains simple A2-level language while including more detail than Model 1. Uses ""studies show"" which accurately reflects the research aspect. The examples are well-adapted (changing ""organizing events"" to ""planning parties""). Includes the concept of natural abilities.

Weaknesses: Does not mention ""growth mindset"" at all. The phrase ""get even better"" adds emphasis not present in the original. Some of the original's precision is reduced through simplification.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Only translation that retains the ""growth mindset"" concept, which is central to the original text. Maintains good A2-level vocabulary while preserving key concepts. The structure follows the original closely. Uses ""research shows"" accurately.

Weaknesses: ""Small things"" is less precise than ""small details"" for the eye for details concept. The final sentence structure is slightly more complex than typical A2 level.

**Overall Assessment:**
Model 3 preserves the most important conceptual elements while maintaining appropriate language level. Model 2 provides good clarity and examples but misses the key ""growth mindset"" term. Model 1 is the most simplified but loses significant content from the original.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for A2 level. Successfully conveys the main points about methane discovery, its short lifespan, and seasonal variation. The breathing metaphor is preserved effectively.

Weaknesses: Omits the concept that methane is an ""organic molecule,"" which is important scientific information. The phrase ""another of the most basic organic molecules"" is simplified to just ""a simple gas,"" losing the connection to organic chemistry.

**Model 2 Feedback:**
Strengths: Retains the ""organic molecule"" concept and adds a helpful definition explaining what organic molecules are. Maintains the key scientific details while using accessible language. Preserves the ""almost like"" qualifier in the breathing metaphor.

Weaknesses: Slightly more complex sentence structure that may challenge A2 learners. The addition of the organic molecule definition, while helpful, makes the text longer and potentially more difficult for the target level.

**Model 3 Feedback:**
Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and maintains clear sentence structure. Adds a helpful comparison to Earth's natural gas for context. The breathing metaphor is enhanced with ""in and out"" for clarity.

Weaknesses: Like Model 1, omits the important concept of ""organic molecules."" The phrase ""can only stay in the air"" is less precise than the original meaning about methane's survival time.

**Overall Assessment:**
Model 1 provides the clearest, most accessible version but sacrifices some scientific accuracy. Model 2 maintains the most scientific content while remaining relatively accessible. Model 3 offers good simplification with helpful Earth comparisons but loses key scientific terminology.

Strengths: Provides clear explanation of ""off-duty"" as ""not working that day."" Uses simple vocabulary throughout. Maintains the story structure well and includes most key information.
Weaknesses: Uses ""find these people"" which could be confusing - it wasn't about locating them physically but identifying them. Like the others, implies Collins personally knew the rioters. Uses ""the computer program"" (singular) instead of ""computer programs"" or ""software,"" which is less accurate to the original.

Strengths:
- Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""ordinary people"" for civilians)
- Maintains clear sentence structure throughout
- Preserves all key statistical information accurately
- Uses straightforward connectors like ""but""

Weaknesses:
- Omits the opening phrase ""As for news stories"" which provides context
- Loses the concept of ""cause for some optimism"" 
- Does not convey that the murder rate decrease was ""slight""
- Missing the word ""also"" when introducing the terrorism point

**Model 2 Analysis:**

Strengths:
- Includes ""often"" which better reflects the original meaning
- Captures the optimistic tone with ""good reasons to feel hopeful""
- Uses ""also"" to properly connect ideas about terrorism
- Clearly explains the murder rate as going ""down a little""
- Maintains good flow between sentences

Weaknesses:
- Uses ""wars inside countries"" instead of ""civil wars"" (civil wars is A2 vocabulary)
- Slightly longer sentences that may challenge A2 readers
- The phrase ""get along"" is somewhat informal

**Model 3 Analysis:**

Strengths:
- Retains ""civil wars"" which is appropriate A2 vocabulary
- Uses ""political fighting"" as a good simplification of ""political conflict""
- Includes ""also"" for proper sentence connection
- Maintains the statistical information clearly
- Good balance of sentence length for A2 level

Weaknesses:
- Uses ""living together"" instead of the more natural ""co-existing""
- Does not fully capture the optimistic tone from the original
- The phrase ""even for ordinary people"" could be clearer

All three models successfully simplify complex vocabulary and maintain the essential meaning. Model 2 best preserves the original's tone and logical flow while using appropriate A2 vocabulary.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for A2 level. Maintains the core meaning while simplifying complex sentences effectively. The phrase ""climbing mountains"" is more accessible than ""mountaineering.""

Weaknesses: Loses some nuance from the original, such as the specific mention of ""humanitarian"" projects and campaigns. The phrase ""doing the trick"" is omitted, which removes some of the original's tone.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains more detail from the original text, including ""protect people's rights"" and ""help campaigns."" Maintains the phrase ""seems to be working"" which captures the original meaning well. Good balance between simplification and content preservation.

Weaknesses: Uses ""help projects"" and ""help campaigns"" which may be less clear than more specific terms. The sentence structure could be slightly simpler in some places.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful definitions for potentially difficult terms like ""human rights"" and ""international,"" which is valuable for A2 learners. Very explicit and educational approach that supports comprehension.

Weaknesses: The added explanations make the text significantly longer and may interrupt reading flow. Some explanations may be unnecessary for A2 level students. The phrase ""working well"" adds emphasis not present in the original.

**Overall Assessment:**
Model 1 provides the cleanest simplification with good readability. Model 2 strikes a balance between simplification and detail retention. Model 3 takes an overly explanatory approach that may hinder natural reading flow despite its educational intent.

Strengths: Uses very simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for A2 level. Successfully conveys the main message about positive changes in developing countries. The phrase ""Good things are happening"" effectively captures the transformation concept in simple terms.

Weaknesses: Oversimplifies ""developing countries"" to just ""poor countries,"" losing some nuance. The sentence structure becomes choppy by breaking up the list of improvements into separate sentences, which affects flow.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the colon structure from the original text, preserving the rhetorical flow. Keeps all statistical information intact and presents the contrasting viewpoints clearly. Uses ""big changes"" as an effective A2-level translation of ""great transformation.""

Weaknesses: The colon usage may be slightly advanced for A2 level. Some sentences are longer and more complex than typical A2 texts.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides more detailed explanation of the problems (""bad leaders who control everything"") while staying within A2 vocabulary. Maintains all key statistics and presents information in a logical sequence. Uses ""real situation"" to emphasize the contrast effectively.

Weaknesses: Contains the longest and most complex sentences of the three models. The phrase ""terrible poverty"" directly mirrors the original, which may be slightly above A2 level. Some sentence structures approach B1 complexity.

**Ranking Assessment:**
Model 2 best balances simplification with content preservation, maintaining the original's structure while using appropriate A2 vocabulary. Model 1 achieves the simplest language but sacrifices some content flow. Model 3 provides good detail but uses more complex sentence structures that push beyond A2 level.

Strengths: Maintains clear sentence structure and preserves the main concepts effectively. Uses appropriate A2-level vocabulary while keeping the logical flow intact. The phrase ""make negative feedback easier to hear"" accurately conveys the original meaning.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""make the negative feedback seem less bad"" is somewhat awkward. Could benefit from slightly more explicit connections between ideas.

Strengths: Uses very clear and natural A2-level language. The phrase ""make the bad news sound better"" is more accessible than technical terms. Maintains good coherence and readability throughout.

Weaknesses: Loses the specific ""sandwich"" metaphor from the original text, which is a key concept. The simplification removes some important nuance about the feedback technique.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Explicitly explains the ""sandwich"" metaphor, making it very clear for A2 learners. Breaks down complex ideas into shorter, more digestible sentences. Provides the most comprehensive explanation of why positive feedback should be valued independently.

Weaknesses: Significantly longer than the original, which may not be ideal for A2 level. Some repetition occurs, particularly around the concept of making feedback ""easier"" or ""less hard to hear."" The expansion, while helpful, moves away from concise communication.

Weaknesses: Slightly longer sentences that may challenge some A2 learners. The same Lewis/Pugh name confusion appears. Some phrases like ""lost their color"" could be more direct for this level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides clear numerical context (""Now only 3 per cent...but he wants 10 per cent""). Uses appropriate A2 vocabulary throughout. Maintains the essential message and urgency. The phrase ""space to heal"" is accessible and meaningful.

Weaknesses: Also contains the Lewis/Pugh name inconsistency. Some sentences could be shorter for optimal A2 comprehension. The phrase ""lots of plastic waste"" is slightly more advanced than necessary.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three translations successfully reduce the complexity for A2 learners and maintain the core environmental message. Each has the same significant weakness of unexplained name switching between Lewis and Pugh. Model 2 provides the most comprehensive information while remaining accessible, though it's slightly more challenging. Model 3 offers good balance and clarity. Model 1 is the most simplified but loses important context.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""famous writer,"" ""dangerous part,"" ""stay safe""). The sentence structure is clear and accessible. Successfully conveys the main narrative arc from her background to current success.

Weaknesses: Loses the specific award name ""Olive Crime Writer Award"" by calling it ""important writing prizes."" Changes ""housing estate"" to ""dangerous part,"" which loses some specificity. The phrase ""these experiences"" is somewhat vague.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains the specific award name ""Olive Crime Writer Award."" Maintains much of the original structure while simplifying vocabulary (""TV shows"" instead of ""daytime shows,"" ""writing meetings"" instead of ""writing conferences"").

Weaknesses: Uses ""poorest part"" instead of explaining the crime connection, which changes the meaning slightly. ""Best-selling author"" at the beginning may be too complex for A2 level. Some phrases like ""what she knew"" could be clearer.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for A2 level. Provides helpful explanations like ""This award is for people who write crime stories."" Breaks down complex ideas into digestible parts. Very clear progression of ideas.

Weaknesses: Becomes quite repetitive and verbose. Some redundancy in explanations may slow down reading. The sentence ""She knows how to tell very good stories"" adds unnecessary length without new information.

**Overall Assessment:**
Model 1 provides good simplification but loses some specific details. Model 2 maintains more original content while making appropriate vocabulary changes. Model 3 offers the most accessible language but becomes overly explanatory and repetitive.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for A2 level. Maintains the core message about human progress and threats to Enlightenment values. The sentence structure is straightforward and accessible.

Weaknesses: Loses some specificity from the original text. ""Politicians"" is less precise than ""commentators and demagogues."" The explanation of tribalism as ""make people feel afraid of other groups"" oversimplifies the concept. ""World co-operation"" becomes the vaguer ""countries working together.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides more detailed explanations that help A2 learners understand complex concepts. ""People who talk on TV and political leaders"" effectively explains ""commentators and demagogues."" Maintains most of the original meaning while using accessible vocabulary.

Weaknesses: Slightly longer and more complex than typical A2 text. Some phrases like ""make them feel hopeless"" could be clearer. The sentence about tribalism, fatalism, and distrust becomes quite long for A2 level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Similar to Model 2 in providing clear explanations of complex terms. Uses simple sentence structures with repeated ""we are/have"" pattern that aids comprehension. Includes quotation marks around the book title, which is more accurate.

Weaknesses: The repetitive sentence structure in the middle paragraph, while simple, becomes somewhat mechanical. ""Try to make people think"" adds an unnecessary word (""try"") that doesn't improve clarity. Otherwise shares similar issues with Model 2 regarding sentence length.

All three models successfully reduce vocabulary complexity and maintain the main arguments. Models 2 and 3 provide better explanations of difficult concepts, while Model 1 prioritizes brevity but loses some precision.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""scary movies,"" ""in trouble,"" ""main person""). Successfully conveys the core message about horror movie tropes.
Weaknesses: ""Main person"" is awkward phrasing instead of ""hero"" or ""protagonist."" Loses some nuance from the original, such as the specific timing aspect (""just when you absolutely need"").

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains more of the original's structure and timing elements (""just when you really need""). Uses ""hero"" which is more natural than ""main person."" Preserves the phrase ""it's almost certain"" which maintains the original's tone.
Weaknesses: Retains some slightly more complex phrasing that may be challenging for A2 learners (""less believable,"" ""at an important moment"").

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Adds helpful clarification with ""What can movie makers do"" which makes the context clearer for A2 learners. Uses simple, clear language throughout. Maintains the logical flow of the original text.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for A2 level. Successfully conveys the main problem and basic information about banana cultivation methods.
Weaknesses: Loses some important details like the connection between thick skin and easy transport. The phrase ""copied parts of banana plants"" is somewhat vague. Missing the detail about mass production efficiency and the dominance of plantations.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains A2-appropriate language while preserving more details from the original. Clearly explains the connection between thick skin and easy transport. Includes the detail about ""millions of bananas"" and mentions the widespread cultivation in Central America.
Weaknesses: The phrase ""grew everywhere in Central America"" slightly misrepresents ""dominated the plantations."" Some sentences could be shorter for A2 level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very clear, simple language suitable for A2 learners. Provides the most detailed explanation of the cloning process in accessible terms. Good use of connecting words like ""So"" and ""Instead"" to show relationships between ideas. Explains the motivation behind the cultivation method clearly.
Weaknesses: Slightly longer and more complex sentence structures in some parts. The opening ""people who grew bananas"" is less precise than ""banana companies.""

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for A2 level. Maintains all key information from the original text. The phrase ""throw special hairs at you"" is clear and direct.

Weaknesses: Uses ""poison"" instead of ""venom"" (though this simplification may be acceptable for A2). Lacks some detail about the urticating hairs' mechanism and doesn't mention the ""wrong way"" idiom adaptation.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides the most complete information transfer, including the concept of not making tarantulas angry (adapting ""rub up the wrong way""). Explains that the hairs ""cause pain and itching"" and ""stick into"" skin/eyes. Uses appropriate A2 vocabulary while retaining more detail.

Weaknesses: Slightly longer sentences that approach the upper limit of A2 complexity. The phrase ""shoot out special hairs"" might be less clear than alternatives.

Strengths: Maintains A2-appropriate language while adding helpful clarifying details like ""themselves"" and ""pick up a copy."" Uses natural connecting words and phrases that improve flow. The phrase ""really like"" adds appropriate emphasis.

Weaknesses: ""Really like"" might be slightly informal for the context. Otherwise maintains good balance between simplification and accuracy.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides clear structure with ""The Scallion is a newspaper that..."" introduction. Uses ""teachers"" instead of ""workers/staff"" which is more accurate. Includes ""very much"" for appropriate emphasis and ""Only students"" for clarity.

Weaknesses: Slightly more complex sentence structures that approach the upper limits of A2 level. Some phrases like ""university grounds"" are less commonly used than ""campus.""

All three models successfully adapt the text to A2 level by using simpler vocabulary, shorter sentences, and more direct language. They maintain the original meaning while making the content accessible to elementary-level learners. The main differences lie in word choice precision, sentence flow, and structural clarity.

118-a2,"At Girox Foods, we are experiencing an annual employee turnover of about 12 per cent. Although this might not seem high at first glance, the industry standard is seven per cent. The principal objective of this report is to investigate the causes of employee engagement within the firm and, based on those, offer recommendations to improve the employees' experience of the workplace and increase employee retention.",claude-sonnet-4,"At Girox Foods, 12% of our workers leave every year.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for A2 level. Successfully converts percentages to accessible language. Maintains the core message about investigating worker dissatisfaction and providing solutions.

Weaknesses: Oversimplifies ""employee engagement"" to just ""workers are not happy,"" which changes the meaning. The phrase ""seems okay"" is too informal for a business report context. Loses some precision from the original text.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Effectively explains percentages using concrete numbers (12 out of 100, 7 out of 100). Maintains appropriate formality with ""main goal"" while keeping language simple. Preserves the logical flow of the original text well.

Weaknesses: Also reduces ""employee engagement"" to ""workers are not happy,"" missing the broader concept. The explanation of percentages, while clear, makes the text longer than necessary.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides clear percentage explanations using concrete numbers. Maintains good structure with logical progression from problem identification to solution. Includes the important detail about understanding problems before providing solutions. Uses appropriate A2-level vocabulary throughout.

Weaknesses: Like the others, simplifies ""employee engagement"" to ""workers are not happy."" The text becomes somewhat lengthy due to the detailed percentage explanations. Some redundancy in explaining the company's goals.

All three models successfully simplify complex business language for A2 learners and maintain the essential meaning. However, all fail to adequately convey the concept of ""employee engagement,"" reducing it to simple unhappiness. Model 3 provides the most complete information while remaining accessible, Model 2 offers good clarity with appropriate length, and Model 1 is the most concise but loses some important details.

119-a2,"So much of what the speaker said rang true. I honestly believe there's a danger that the more connected we are, the more isolated we feel. I don't think this is such an issue for my generation who've lived without technology for so long. We know how to be alone and, more importantly, we know that it's OK to be alone. But the under 20s are another kettle of fish. They're so busy communicating that they never experience the feeling of solitude and run the risk of not learning how to enjoy their own company. In addition, they're learning conversation through messages that can be edited and changed at the expense of learning the art of real conversation in real time with the person in front of you.",claude-sonnet-4,"I agree with what the speaker said. I think when we use technology more, we can feel more alone. This isn't a big problem for older people like me. We lived without technology for a long time. We know how to be alone and we know it's OK to be alone. But young people under 20 are different. They always communicate with others, so they never learn to be alone. They don't learn to enjoy being by themselves. Also, they learn to talk through messages that they can change and edit. But they don't learn how to have real conversations with people face to face.","So much of what the speaker said was right.

We know how to be alone and we know that being alone is OK. But young people under 20 are very different. They are always talking to people on their phones, so they never learn what it feels like to be alone. They might not learn how to enjoy being by themselves. Also, they learn to talk to people by writing messages. They can change and fix these messages before they send them. But they don't learn how to have real conversations with people who are with them right now.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for A2 level. Successfully conveys the main ideas about technology causing isolation and generational differences. The contrast between older and younger generations is clear.

Weaknesses: Loses some nuance from the original text. The phrase ""kettle of fish"" is completely omitted rather than adapted. Some connections between ideas could be clearer.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains more of the original's tone and meaning while using accessible language. Successfully adapts ""kettle of fish"" to ""completely different."" Preserves the emphasis on real-time conversation vs. edited messages.

Weaknesses: Uses some phrases that may be challenging for A2 learners, such as ""more importantly"" and complex sentence structures. The sentence about being ""more connected"" retains some complexity.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very clear, simple language throughout. Breaks down complex ideas into shorter, more digestible sentences. The explanation of message editing is particularly clear and detailed.

Weaknesses: The flow between sentences is sometimes choppy due to over-simplification. Some meaning is lost in the process of simplification, making it feel more basic than necessary for A2 level.

**Overall Assessment:**
Model 1 provides a solid simplification but loses some content. Model 2 balances accessibility with meaning retention most effectively, though it occasionally uses more complex structures. Model 3 prioritizes simplicity but sometimes at the cost of natural flow and complete meaning transfer.

120-a2,"Don't always follow positive feedback with negative feedback. When positive and negative feedback always appear to go hand in hand, the positives can become devalued and ignored. Ensure there are times when positive feedback is given for its own sake and resist the temptation to offer constructive criticism.",claude-sonnet-4,"Don't always give negative feedback after positive feedback. When you always give both together, people will not value the positive comments. Sometimes just give positive feedback on its own. Don't always add criticism.","Don't always give bad feedback after good feedback. When good and bad feedback always come together, people stop believing the good things you say. Make sure you sometimes give good feedback by itself. Don't always feel you need to add things that need to be better.","Don't always give bad feedback after good feedback. When good and bad feedback always come together, people stop believing the good things you say. Sometimes you should only give good feedback and not say anything bad. Don't always try to tell people what they did wrong when you also tell them what they did well.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses appropriate A2-level vocabulary with clear sentence structures. The phrase ""people will not value the positive comments"" effectively conveys the devaluation concept. Maintains the core message concisely.
Weaknesses: The final sentence ""Don't always add criticism"" is somewhat abrupt and could be clearer about when not to add criticism.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""good/bad"" instead of ""positive/negative""). The explanation ""people stop believing the good things you say"" clearly conveys the consequence. The final sentence effectively paraphrases ""constructive criticism"" in accessible language.
Weaknesses: The phrase ""don't always feel you need to"" introduces a slightly more complex grammatical structure that may be challenging for A2 learners.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and clear cause-and-effect relationships. The phrase ""people stop believing the good things you say"" effectively communicates the main consequence.
Weaknesses: The final sentence is unnecessarily long and complex for A2 level, potentially confusing learners. Some redundancy in explaining the same concept multiple ways may overwhelm rather than clarify.

**Overall Comparison:**
All three models successfully simplify the vocabulary and maintain the original meaning. Models 2 and 3 both use ""good/bad"" terminology which is more accessible than Model 1's ""positive/negative."" However, Model 3 becomes overly verbose in its final explanation, while Model 2 maintains clarity throughout. Model 1 provides the most concise version but uses slightly more advanced vocabulary.
