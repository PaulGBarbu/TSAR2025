But to really understand what they mean for you, think about what happens in your life and how you feel every day.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple, clear vocabulary appropriate for A2 level. The sentence structure is straightforward and easy to follow. ""Naked in public"" is direct and commonly understood. The final sentence maintains clarity while preserving the original meaning.

Weaknesses: ""Similar meanings"" is slightly less precise than the original concept. The connection between dreams and daily events could be more explicitly stated.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains good A2-level simplicity. Uses ""what's happening"" which is more natural and conversational. Adds ""every day"" which emphasizes the daily life connection from the original text. The phrase ""to really understand"" adds appropriate emphasis.

Weaknesses: Uses the same ""naked in public"" phrasing, which may be considered slightly informal for some contexts.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses ""without clothes"" instead of ""naked,"" which may be more appropriate for A2 learners and sounds more formal. Includes ""every day"" to emphasize the daily life connection. Uses ""what happens in your life"" which is clear and direct.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""without clothes"" is slightly more wordy than necessary, though still appropriate for the level.

**Comparative Analysis:**
All three models successfully simplify the complex original text to A2 level. They all preserve the main ideas: dreams reveal subconscious thoughts, common dream types exist, and personal interpretation requires connecting dreams to daily life. The vocabulary choices are consistently appropriate, and sentence structures are simplified effectively.

The main differences lie in word choice (""naked"" vs ""without clothes"") and slight variations in emphasis (""really understand"" vs ""understand,"" ""every day"" inclusion).

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for A2 level. Successfully conveys the main points about the book's popularity, awards, and educational use.
Weaknesses: Omits that RJ Palacio is a New Yorker (important biographical detail). The phrase ""different face"" is somewhat awkward compared to ""different-looking face."" Loses the specific mention of ""facial deformities"" being simplified.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains key biographical information about the author being from New York. Uses natural A2-level phrasing like ""different-looking face"" and ""sold very well."" Preserves the personal tone with ""including me."" Good balance of simplification while retaining important details.
Weaknesses: Changes ""bestseller"" to ""sold very well"" which slightly alters the meaning. The phrase ""lots of people"" is less formal than the original context suggests.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains the New York biographical detail. Uses appropriate A2 vocabulary throughout. The phrase ""became very popular"" effectively translates ""bestseller."" Maintains the present continuous tense for ongoing actions. The ending ""read more from RJ Palacio in the future"" captures the anticipation element well.
Weaknesses: Slightly longer sentences that approach the upper limit of A2 complexity. The phrase ""in the future"" adds words not present in the original.

**Overall Comparison:**
All three models successfully simplify the vocabulary and sentence structure for A2 level. Models 2 and 3 preserve more biographical context than Model 1. Model 3 maintains the most accurate verb tenses and formal tone. Model 2 uses the most natural-sounding simplified language. Model 1 is the most concise but loses some important details.

Strengths: Maintains accurate content and preserves key details like King Minos's name. Uses appropriate A2-level vocabulary while keeping the text concise. The phrase ""modern version"" effectively conveys the comparison.

Weaknesses: Uses ""futuristic"" incorrectly as ""modern"" - Katniss is from a future dystopia, not modern times. The word ""tale"" might be slightly advanced for A2 level.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very accessible A2 vocabulary with phrases like ""old Greek stories,"" ""really liked,"" and ""scary creature."" Adds helpful context by identifying Katniss as ""the main character."" The phrase ""future version"" accurately reflects the original meaning.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""fought back"" appears twice, creating repetition. Could be more concise in some areas.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains clear A2-level language and includes helpful context about Katniss being the main character. Preserves all essential story elements and uses ""future version"" correctly.

Weaknesses: Contains redundancy with ""monster"" and ""Minotaur"" in the same sentence. The structure could be more streamlined.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three models successfully adapt the text to A2 level while preserving the core narrative. Model 2 uses the most consistently accessible vocabulary and provides the clearest explanations for A2 learners. Model 3 maintains good clarity but has minor redundancy issues.

Weaknesses: Omits the specific weight detail (eight tons) and the full name of HAMMER. Does not explain what PHA stands for, though it simplifies this to ""asteroid.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very accessible language by replacing ""asteroid"" with ""space rock"" and ""PHA"" with ""big space rock."" Maintains good sentence flow and includes all key concepts. The vocabulary choices are well-suited for A2 learners.

Weaknesses: Omits the eight-ton specification and the full HAMMER acronym expansion. The phrase ""big space rock"" appears twice, which could have been varied.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes the specific eight-ton detail that other models omitted. Uses simple vocabulary like ""big rock from space"" instead of technical terms. Provides clear explanations and maintains logical flow. Adds helpful context with ""there is no time to push it away.""

Weaknesses: The phrase ""big rock from space that is coming to hit Earth"" is somewhat awkward. Does not expand the HAMMER acronym, though it does mention it's from NASA.

**Ranking Assessment:**
Model 3 provides the most complete information by including the eight-ton specification while maintaining A2-appropriate language. Model 2 offers the clearest vocabulary choices for the target level. Model 1 provides a solid translation but lacks some specific details.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level, maintains clear structure, and preserves the main contrast between the two theories. The sentence structure is straightforward and accessible.

Weaknesses: Translates ""18th and 19th centuries"" as ""1800s and 1900s"" which is factually incorrect (18th century = 1700s). Omits ""the problems they cause"" from Freud's theory. Uses vague terms like ""random thoughts"" instead of the more specific ""random activity"" or ""images and feelings.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Correctly translates the centuries (18th = 1700s, 19th = 1800s). Includes the complete information about problems that hidden feelings cause. Introduces Freud as ""a man named Freud"" which helps A2 learners. Uses concrete terms like ""thoughts and pictures.""

Weaknesses: Slightly longer sentences that may be more challenging for A2 level. The phrase ""thoughts and pictures"" appears twice, creating some repetition.

She reached the South Pole 40 days later. She pulled a sledge with her tent and all her food behind her through very cold weather and ice storms.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for A2 level. Maintains all key information from the original text. The sentence structure is clear and accessible.

Weaknesses: The opening lacks the connecting idea of going ""from challenge to challenge."" Some word choices like ""tallest"" instead of ""highest"" slightly change meaning. The transition between sentences could be smoother.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides good context with ""keep looking for new challenges"" and uses clear A2-level vocabulary. Explains ""glacier"" as ""deep crack in the ice"" which aids comprehension. Good paragraph structure separating the introduction from the main story.

Weaknesses: Uses ""sled"" instead of ""sledge,"" which changes the original terminology. The phrase ""very hot"" is somewhat redundant when followed by the specific temperature.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Captures the original meaning well with ""one exciting trip after another."" Provides helpful explanation of glacier with ""(a big block of ice)."" Maintains the original word ""sledge"" and includes comprehensive details about her achievements.

Weaknesses: The explanation of glacier as ""a big block of ice"" is not entirely accurate - glaciers are much larger formations. Some sentences are slightly longer, which may challenge A2 readers.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three models successfully simplify the text for A2 level while preserving the main narrative. Model 1 is the most concise but loses some connecting elements. Model 2 provides good explanatory context and clear paragraph breaks. Model 3 maintains the closest connection to the original meaning while adding helpful clarifications, though the glacier explanation could be more precise.

Today, he wants people to think about important social problems. He paints pictures of homeless people in big cities to make others notice and care about homelessness.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for A2 level. The word ""aware"" is accessible. Maintains the core meaning while simplifying effectively.
Weaknesses: Loses the detail about Paris being his home city. ""Social problems"" is more general than ""different social issues and problems"" but this simplification is appropriate for A2.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains the hometown reference with ""his hometown."" Uses ""important social problems"" which adds helpful context. The phrase ""notice and think about"" effectively captures the original's ""encourage residents to think about.""
Weaknesses: Slightly longer sentences that may be more challenging for A2 learners. ""Important"" adds a word not in the original but serves the simplification purpose.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the location reference with ""where he lives."" Uses ""important social problems"" for clarity. The phrase ""notice and care about"" effectively conveys the emotional aspect of encouraging awareness.
Weaknesses: ""Care about"" introduces an emotional element not explicitly in the original, though it captures the intent. Sentence length is similar to Model 2.

**Comparison:**
All three models successfully simplify vocabulary and sentence structure for A2 level. Model 1 is the most concise but loses some contextual information. Models 2 and 3 preserve more detail from the original while remaining accessible. Model 3's use of ""care about"" adds emotional resonance that aligns with the artist's intent, while Model 2's ""notice and think about"" stays closer to the original's ""encourage residents to think about.""

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for A2 level. The core message is clear and accessible.
Weaknesses: Changes ""councils"" to ""cities"" which alters the meaning. Omits the concept of ""randomly"" painting, losing the distinction between unauthorized and designated painting. The phrase ""to stop them from painting anywhere"" is inaccurate - the goal is redirection, not prevention.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the original meaning more accurately by using ""local leaders"" for ""councils."" Preserves the key concept of providing alternative spaces. Includes ""freely"" which captures the spirit of the designated zones.
Weaknesses: The phrase ""tried to stop artists from painting graffiti anywhere"" misrepresents the original intent, which was about random/unauthorized painting, not all painting. Uses ""local leaders"" twice, creating repetition.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Most accurately conveys the original meaning by specifying ""without permission,"" which captures the ""randomly"" concept from the source. Clearly explains the alternative approach with ""Instead, they let artists paint in special areas."" Uses appropriate A2-level vocabulary while maintaining accuracy.
Weaknesses: Slightly longer sentences that approach the upper limit of A2 complexity. Minor repetition with ""special areas"" and ""special areas called 'graffiti zones.'""

All three translations successfully simplify the vocabulary and sentence structure for A2 level. Model 3 provides the most faithful representation of the original meaning, while Models 1 and 2 contain semantic inaccuracies that change the intended message about encouraging designated rather than random graffiti painting.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for A2 level. Successfully simplifies ""colourful"" to ""bright"" and ""temporary"" to ""does not last forever."" Maintains the core meaning while using accessible vocabulary.
Weaknesses: Changes ""pavements"" to ""streets"" which slightly alters the specific location. The phrase ""city cleaners"" is less clear than specifying ""city workers.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides good detail with ""rain"" as a specific weather example. Uses ""sidewalks"" which is clearer than ""pavements"" for many learners. The phrase ""city workers cleaning it up"" is more explicit and easier to understand.
Weaknesses: Changes ""likes to explore different locations"" to ""enjoys visiting different places,"" which shifts the meaning from artistic exploration to tourism. Uses ""broken-down cars"" instead of ""abandoned cars,"" changing the original meaning.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains close fidelity to the original meaning. Uses ""sidewalks"" for clarity. Provides specific examples like ""rain"" while keeping language simple. The final sentence structure with the dash effectively emphasizes the life cycle concept.
Weaknesses: The sentence ""It can disappear because of rain or city workers who clean it"" has slightly awkward phrasing with the relative clause.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and clear sentence structure appropriate for A2 level. Maintains the core meaning while simplifying language effectively.
Weaknesses: Omits the important detail that the brothers are ""identical"" twins, which is specified in the original text. The phrase ""sides of buildings"" is simplified to just ""buildings,"" losing some specificity.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains the ""identical"" concept by explaining it as ""who look exactly the same,"" making it accessible to A2 learners. Explains ""cranes"" as ""big machines called cranes,"" providing helpful context. Uses ""bright"" as a synonym for ""colourful.""
Weaknesses: Slightly longer and more complex than necessary for A2 level. The explanation of identical twins adds unnecessary length to the sentence.

Then, you can start to see how your dreams connect to things that happen in your life and how you feel every day.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple sentence structures appropriate for A2 level. Maintains the core message about writing dreams and connecting them to daily life. Grammar is correct and vocabulary is accessible.

Weaknesses: Omits the modal verb ""might"" from ""they might add to the meaning,"" changing it to a more definitive ""can help."" Loses the element of surprise (""you'll be surprised"") from the original. The phrase ""things that happen in your daily life"" is less specific than including both ""events and feelings.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Preserves the conditional aspect with ""might help"" which maintains the original's tentative tone. Includes both events and feelings in the final sentence. Uses appropriate A2-level vocabulary while keeping the meaning intact. Maintains good sentence flow.

Weaknesses: Uses ""what the dream means"" instead of ""the meaning,"" which is slightly more complex grammatically. The phrase structure is generally more complex than necessary for A2 level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and clear sentence structures. Explicitly mentions ""every day"" which reinforces the daily life connection. Includes both events and feelings like the original.

Weaknesses: Changes ""After a week"" to ""After one week,"" which is unnecessary and slightly more formal. Uses ""that you have written a lot"" instead of ""how much you have written,"" losing the quantitative aspect. The phrase ""what the dream means"" adds complexity.

This was particularly true of old-fashioned train bridges, where the spark created by the steel wheels and steel tracks could sometimes cause a bridge to catch fire and burn to the ground.",mistral-medium-3,"In the past, many bridges were made of wood and could easily catch fire. This was especially a problem for old train bridges. The sparks from the steel wheels and tracks could sometimes start a fire and burn the bridge completely.","In the past, most bridges were made of wood, which made them easy to catch fire. This was especially a problem for old train bridges.

These bridges could catch fire easily. This was especially true for old train bridges. The sparks from the train wheels and tracks could sometimes start a fire and burn the bridge completely.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level. Maintains the core meaning about wooden bridges and fire risk. The phrase ""burn the bridge completely"" effectively conveys total destruction.

Weaknesses: ""Many bridges"" is less precise than the original's comparative ""more bridges."" The sentence structure could be slightly more varied.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses ""most bridges"" which better captures the historical prevalence mentioned in the original. Includes ""the whole bridge could burn down"" which clearly expresses complete destruction. Vocabulary remains accessible for A2 learners.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""made them easy to catch fire"" contains a grammatical error - should be ""made them easy to catch fire"" or ""made it easy for them to catch fire.""

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very simple vocabulary with ""people built"" making the subject clear. Maintains the essential information about fire risk and train bridges. The structure is straightforward for A2 comprehension.

Weaknesses: Changes ""steel wheels and steel tracks"" to just ""train wheels and tracks,"" losing the specific detail about steel creating sparks. ""Built more bridges from wood"" is less natural than other phrasings.

All three translations successfully simplify the original text for A2 level while preserving the main ideas about wooden bridges, fire susceptibility, and train-related fire hazards. The vocabulary choices are generally appropriate for the target level.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and clear sentence structures appropriate for A2 level. Successfully simplifies ""legitimate art form"" to ""real art"" and ""here to stay"" to ""will continue."" Maintains good flow and readability.

Weaknesses: Loses some specificity by changing ""neighbourhood"" to just ""cities."" The phrase ""some trends are clear"" is slightly less precise than the original meaning of emerging trends.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very accessible vocabulary with ""new things are happening"" as a clear simplification of ""trends are emerging."" Maintains the distinction between ""city or area"" which preserves more of the original meaning. The phrase ""isn't going away"" is a natural A2-level expression.

Weaknesses: The sentence ""But now, more artists are traveling"" could be smoother without the ""But now"" construction. Some sentences are slightly longer than optimal for A2 level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides clear vocabulary choices and maintains good structure. Uses ""we can see some new things happening"" which effectively simplifies the concept of emerging trends. Preserves the original meaning well with ""city or area.""

Weaknesses: Contains some unnecessarily complex constructions like ""Some artists also use the internet to talk to each other"" which could be simpler. The phrase ""will not disappear"" is more formal than needed for A2 level.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and sentence structure appropriate for A2 level. Maintains key numerical data and birth year range. Preserves the core meaning efficiently.
Weaknesses: Omits several important topics from the PwC survey (communication, working styles, career development). Does not explain what ""millennials"" means for A2 learners who may be unfamiliar with the term.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes more comprehensive coverage of survey topics. Uses A2-appropriate vocabulary like ""talking with coworkers"" instead of ""communication."" Explains concepts in simpler terms (""young workers"" for millennials, ""good and bad things"" for threats and opportunities).
Weaknesses: Loses the specific term ""millennials"" which appears in the original text. The phrase ""many born between 1983 and 1993"" is less precise than the original distinction between millennial and non-millennial respondents.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and sentence structures appropriate for A2 level. Maintains all key information from the original text. Uses clear transitions like ""Besides his adventures"" and explains concepts in accessible language.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""What is amazing is that"" feels slightly awkward compared to more natural A2 expressions. Some word choices like ""adventurer who has done many exciting things"" add unnecessary length.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses natural A2-level language with good flow. The contraction ""What's amazing"" sounds more conversational. Adds the descriptive word ""hot"" which helps A2 learners visualize the desert setting. Uses ""stay active"" which is simpler than ""live active lives.""

Weaknesses: Includes the word ""even"" which adds slight complexity that may not be necessary at A2 level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains clear, simple language throughout. Uses ""stay active"" like Model 2. The phrase ""What makes this even more amazing"" provides good sentence variety.

Weaknesses: Adds interpretive content with ""to show them what they can do"" which wasn't in the original text. This addition changes the meaning slightly and may confuse learners about the original intent.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for A2 level. The sentence structure is straightforward and easy to follow. Successfully conveys the main concept of online selling being easier than traditional methods.

Weaknesses: Omits the opening concept of ""democratised platforms"" entirely. Loses the specific detail about ""car boot sale"" and doesn't mention that the baby clothes were ""hardly worn."" The phrase ""earn extra money easily"" doesn't capture the colloquial ""make a quick buck or two.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains good A2-level vocabulary while preserving more original details. Includes the concept of expensive baby items and the idea of getting money back. The phrase ""grown out of"" effectively translates ""outgrown."" Uses appropriate connecting words like ""but now"" and ""this way.""

Weaknesses: ""Online selling sites"" and ""online shops"" creates inconsistent terminology. Doesn't capture the ""democratised"" aspect or the ""quick buck"" colloquialism. Slightly repetitive with ""before"" and ""But now.""

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level. Maintains the core narrative structure and key plot points. The sentence ""The story changes then"" effectively conveys the shift in the narrative.

Weaknesses: Loses some important details like ""Pacific"" and ""burning heat."" The phrase ""feels better because of his three religions"" oversimplifies the concept of finding comfort in religion. Omits the specific mention that they need to find out what happens ""once land is in sight.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains more detail than Model 1, including ""big storms"" and maintains the personal tone with ""I won't tell you the end."" Preserves the specific reference to what happens ""when they reach land."" Uses appropriate A2 vocabulary throughout.

Weaknesses: Changes ""lifeboat"" to ""small boat,"" which loses the specific maritime context. The phrase ""but it is very hard"" adds unnecessary explanation. Does not mention the Pacific Ocean specifically.

She liked this time of day because she could play with her pet rats.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple sentence structures appropriate for A2 level. Maintains the core narrative flow and includes all key story elements. The vocabulary is accessible and straightforward.

Weaknesses: Loses some detail from the original, such as ""made herself"" becomes just ""made"" and ""beloved jazz"" becomes simply ""jazz."" The phrase ""evening sounds of chatter"" is simplified to just ""talking,"" which removes some descriptive richness while still remaining within A2 vocabulary range.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains ""made herself"" which preserves the reflexive pronoun from the original. Uses ""got home"" which is natural A2-level language. Includes ""favorite"" to replace ""beloved,"" maintaining the emotional connection to the jazz music. Uses an em dash to organize the list of sounds, which aids comprehension.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""full of noise"" followed by the dash and list creates a slightly more complex sentence structure that approaches the upper limits of A2 level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains ""made herself"" and includes ""decided to do it later,"" which adds clarity about Chloe's decision-making process. Preserves ""favorite jazz music"" and keeps all essential story elements. Uses ""came back"" as a natural variation for ""arrived.""

Weaknesses: The addition of ""decided"" creates a slightly longer sentence structure. ""Came back"" is less precise than ""came home"" since the original emphasizes arriving home rather than returning.

All three models successfully adapt the text to A2 level by shortening sentences, simplifying vocabulary, and maintaining the story's essential elements. Model 2 provides the best balance of simplification while retaining meaningful details from the original text.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level, maintains clear structure, and preserves key numerical information (90%, 50 million kilometres, 50 more to find, 887 known asteroids).

Weaknesses: Omits the specific ""1km wide"" measurement detail, loses the technical term ""planetary defence team,"" and uses ""big asteroids"" which is less precise than the original specification.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains the crucial ""1 kilometer wide"" specification, explains ""near-Earth objects"" clearly, uses A2-appropriate phrase ""space rocks,"" and accurately conveys ""Earth's path around the sun"" for orbit concept.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""watches for dangerous space rocks"" slightly shifts the meaning from ""planetary defence team,"" and the text is somewhat longer, which may challenge A2 readers.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary suitable for A2 level, clearly explains the team's protective role, and maintains the orbit explanation as ""Earth's path around the sun.""

Weaknesses: Completely omits the critical ""1km wide"" measurement, changes ""significant danger"" to ""hit Earth and cause big problems"" which alters the meaning, and loses precision about the threat assessment.

**Key Differences:**

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for A2 level. Maintains the core meaning about the boy's potential escape and the horse-related concerns.
Weaknesses: Loses the ""northern end"" specification by using just ""north side."" Omits the visual scope (""as far as the eye could see"") and the rebellious aspect of the teenager. ""Heavy hooves"" becomes just ""kicking the ground,"" losing descriptive detail.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Preserves more original details including ""as far as they could see"" and explicitly mentions both ""bored"" and rule-breaking behavior. Uses ""stomping"" and ""strong feet"" to maintain the physical description of the horse. Vocabulary remains accessible for A2 learners.
Weaknesses: Uses ""north side"" instead of ""northern end."" The phrase ""break the rules"" may be slightly less direct than ""rebellious"" for A2 comprehension.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes both emotional states (bored, rule-breaking) and maintains the horse description with ""strong feet."" Uses clear, simple sentence structures. Explicitly states ""ride a horse"" for clarity.
Weaknesses: Changes ""northern end"" to ""far end,"" losing directional specificity. Omits the scope reference (""as far as the eye could see""). The phrase ""far end of the land"" is less precise than the original meaning.

**Ranking Assessment:**
Model 2 retains the most essential details while maintaining A2-appropriate language, including the visual scope and dual emotional states. Model 3 provides good clarity but loses important spatial references. Model 1 is the most simplified but omits several key descriptive elements that help readers understand the setting and situation.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and sentence structures appropriate for A2 level. The text flows naturally and is easy to understand.
Weaknesses: Omits ""to the top of"" which changes the meaning slightly. Simplifies ""fell in love with mountain climbing as a teenager"" to just ""loved climbing when she was young,"" losing some specificity about her age and the intensity of her passion.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains ""to the top of Everest"" preserving the original meaning. Includes ""Even though"" which shows cause-and-effect relationships while remaining A2-appropriate. Uses ""tall mountains"" as a good A2 alternative to ""high mountains."" Adds ""still climbed"" which emphasizes continuity.
Weaknesses: ""Bad storms"" is less precise than ""violent storms"" but this is acceptable for A2 level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Preserves ""to the top of Everest"" maintaining accuracy. Uses clear, simple sentence structures. Includes ""she still climbed"" showing the continuation of her hobby. The phrase ""13 to 80 years old"" is more explicit than other versions.
Weaknesses: Uses ""very high mountains"" instead of finding an A2 alternative like ""tall mountains."" The sentence structure is somewhat repetitive with multiple short sentences.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and sentence structures appropriate for A2 level. Successfully simplifies ""8,000 metre peaks"" to ""highest mountains"" and ""low oxygen levels"" to ""the air is very thin."" Maintains all key information from the original.

Weaknesses: Loses the specific detail about the 8,000-meter height, which is an important factual element. The phrase ""oxygen tanks"" remains unchanged when ""extra oxygen"" might be more accessible.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains the specific 8,000-meter detail while making it accessible. Uses ""extra oxygen"" instead of ""oxygen tanks,"" which is simpler. Adds ""Mount"" before Everest for clarity. Sentence structure remains appropriate for A2 level.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""which are over 8,000 meters high"" creates a longer, more complex sentence structure. Uses ""supports"" in addition to ""help,"" adding slight redundancy.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very simple sentence structures with clear separation of ideas. Simplifies ""oxygen tanks"" to ""extra oxygen."" Explains the oxygen problem in very basic terms (""very little oxygen""). Makes the connection between fame and charity work explicit and clear.

Weaknesses: Creates choppy flow with overly fragmented sentences. The phrase ""which are over 8,000 meters tall"" uses ""tall"" instead of ""high,"" which is less precise for mountains. Adds unnecessary words in the final sentence.

All three translations successfully convey the main information and use vocabulary appropriate for A2 level. Model 2 maintains the best balance between simplification and information retention. Model 3 uses the simplest language but sacrifices flow. Model 1 provides good simplification but loses important specific details.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for A2 level. ""People have always believed"" effectively simplifies ""Throughout history and across cultures."" The sentence structure is straightforward and accessible.
Weaknesses: Loses the cultural diversity aspect by omitting ""across cultures."" ""Special knowledge"" is less precise than the original's ""knowledge or insight.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains both temporal and cultural elements with ""for a long time and in many places."" Preserves the dual concept of ""information or wisdom"" which closely matches the original's ""knowledge or insight."" Uses appropriate A2 vocabulary.
Weaknesses: The phrase ""in many places"" is slightly less natural than other options for expressing cultural universality.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Clear and simple language suitable for A2 level. ""People in many places"" flows naturally. Maintains the essential meaning while using accessible vocabulary.
Weaknesses: Omits the ""wisdom/insight"" component by only mentioning ""important information,"" making it less complete than the original. The temporal aspect ""for a long time"" is less comprehensive than ""throughout history.""

Strengths: Uses appropriate A2-level vocabulary with clear, simple sentence structures. Maintains the core meaning while simplifying complex terms like ""bodies of water"" to ""rivers"" and ""mountain gorges"" to ""valleys."" The phrase ""carefully checked"" effectively simplifies ""subject to intense scrutiny.""

Weaknesses: Loses the specific mention of ""building bridges"" from the original opening, which changes the emphasis slightly. The phrase ""if they fall down"" uses conditional tense rather than temporal ""when,"" subtly altering the meaning.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Preserves the ""building bridges"" concept from the original text. Uses accessible vocabulary and maintains good sentence flow. The phrase ""pay close attention to them"" is a natural A2-level equivalent for ""subject to intense scrutiny.""

Weaknesses: The phrase ""transportation projects ever have been about building bridges"" is somewhat awkward and less natural than other versions. Uses ""deep valleys"" instead of the simpler ""valleys,"" adding unnecessary complexity.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very simple vocabulary and clear sentence structures appropriate for A2 level.

Strengths: Uses simple sentence structures and basic vocabulary appropriate for A2 level. Maintains the core meaning of the original text. The word ""frustrated"" is retained, which may be familiar to A2 learners.

Weaknesses: ""Frustrated for weeks"" changes the temporal structure from the original. The phrase ""working well"" slightly alters the meaning from ""performing."" Some vocabulary like ""frustrated"" and ""unclear"" might be challenging for A2 learners.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Replaces ""frustrated"" with ""feeling upset,"" which uses more basic vocabulary. Maintains the temporal structure with ""After weeks of."" Uses ""boss"" instead of ""manager,"" which is simpler vocabulary. Preserves most of the original meaning and context.

Weaknesses: The sentence ""Her boss just asked if she thought her team was still doing a good job"" is somewhat long for A2 level. ""Believed"" might be more complex than necessary for this level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very simple vocabulary throughout. ""Upset"" is more accessible than ""frustrated."" Uses ""boss"" instead of ""manager."" Breaks down complex ideas into simpler components. The final sentence uses basic sentence structure.

Weaknesses: Loses the temporal structure by starting with ""Gabriela was upset for weeks"" instead of maintaining ""After weeks of."" The repetition of ""did not"" in the final sentence, while grammatically correct, creates a slightly awkward rhythm.

All three models successfully reduce complexity while maintaining the essential narrative. Model 2 best balances vocabulary simplification with structural preservation.

Strengths: Uses appropriate A2-level vocabulary and sentence structures. Maintains factual accuracy regarding the journey details, location, and dangers. The phrase ""reached the river's end"" is clear and simple.

Weaknesses: Changes ""a few thousand"" to ""many,"" which reduces the specific magnitude mentioned in the original text. The quantification becomes less precise.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Preserves the original quantification by keeping ""thousands of mosquito and ant bites,"" maintaining the scale described in the source text. Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level. Sentence structure is clear and accessible.

Weaknesses: Minor inconsistency in using ""kilometers"" vs ""kilometres"" compared to other models, though both spellings are acceptable.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses clear, simple language suitable for A2 learners. Maintains good sentence flow and structure. Factually accurate regarding the journey details and timeline.

Weaknesses: Like Model 1, reduces ""a few thousand"" to ""many,"" losing the specific quantification from the original. Uses American spelling ""kilometers"" instead of British ""kilometres"" (though this may be intentional for the target audience).

**Overall Comparison:**
All three models successfully simplify the language to A2 level while maintaining the core narrative. The main difference lies in how they handle the quantification of insect bites. Models 1 and 3 use the vague term ""many,"" while Model 2 preserves the more specific ""thousands,"" which better reflects the original text's emphasis on the large number of bites Ed endured.

Strengths: Maintains clear sentence structure and preserves most key information. Uses appropriate A2-level vocabulary like ""hardest areas"" and ""speak out against."" The flow between sentences is smooth.

Weaknesses: ""Could not have walked"" is slightly awkward phrasing. Loses some specificity by changing ""guide him through"" to ""helped him through"" and omitting the protest aspect explicitly.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses natural contractions (""couldn't have done"") appropriate for A2 level. Maintains the specific meaning of ""permission to walk on their land."" Clearly explains ""charities that help the environment and children"" which aids comprehension.

Weaknesses: ""Attention from the news"" changes the original meaning of ""media interest."" The sentence structure becomes slightly repetitive with multiple ""and"" connectors.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very clear, simple language like ""let him walk"" and ""what he did every day."" Breaks down complex ideas into smaller, more digestible parts. ""Talk about the problems in the rainforest"" is very accessible.

Weaknesses: Oversimplifies ""guide him through the most difficult terrain"" to just ""go through the hardest parts of the forest,"" losing some meaning. ""Talk about the problems"" is less precise than ""protest about the destruction."" Creates choppy rhythm by breaking one sentence into two separate ones about using attention and raising money.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""unused resources"" might be slightly advanced for A2 level. Could benefit from more explicit explanation of the middleman concept.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""sharing things,"" ""websites or apps""). Includes the important middleman concept with the phrase ""act as a bridge."" Provides clear explanations of both examples with context about travelers and free time.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""don't use much"" is grammatically awkward and unclear. The sentence structure in the first paragraph could be clearer.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple, accessible vocabulary throughout. Clearly explains the Airbnb concept with ""earn money from their empty spaces."" Maintains good sentence structure that flows logically for A2 learners.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""give them a product or service"" is imprecise - services aren't typically ""given."" Missing the middleman/intermediary concept entirely, which is important to understanding how these platforms work. Less comprehensive coverage of the original content.

**Overall Assessment:**
Model 1 provides the most complete and accurate translation while maintaining appropriate complexity. Model 2 includes important concepts but has some grammatical issues. Model 3 uses the simplest language but omits key information about how these platforms function as intermediaries.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level. Maintains the core narrative structure and key plot points. The sentence ""so he climbs back into the lifeboat"" flows naturally.

Weaknesses: Loses the specific detail ""one by one"" which shows the gradual process. Changes ""seasick"" to just ""sick,"" removing the specific cause. The phrase ""does not want to eat Pi"" is less precise than the original's ""has no immediate interest in eating him.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains ""one after another"" which preserves the sequential nature of events. Explains seasickness clearly as ""feels sick from the boat's movement."" Uses ""luckily for Pi"" which matches the original phrasing better. Changes ""ocean"" to ""sea"" which is simpler vocabulary.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""knows he must get back"" is slightly more complex than necessary for A2. Uses ""which he calls"" instead of simpler alternatives.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level. Maintains clear sentence structure and preserves all key information from the original text. The translation is concise while retaining scientific accuracy.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""part of natural gas"" is less precise than describing methane as a ""key ingredient"" or ""main part."" The ending lacks the complete breathing metaphor present in the original.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides the most complete translation of technical details, describing methane as both ""simple organic molecule"" and ""main part of natural gas."" Includes the full breathing metaphor with ""breathing it in and out."" Maintains scientific accuracy while using A2-appropriate language.

Weaknesses: Slightly more complex sentence structures that may challenge some A2 learners. The phrase ""during different times of the year"" is wordier than necessary.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very simple language suitable for A2 level. The phrase ""from time to time"" effectively translates ""periodically."" Includes the complete breathing metaphor.

Weaknesses: Contains a significant factual error by describing methane simply as ""a simple natural gas"" rather than explaining it as an organic molecule and component of natural gas. This oversimplification loses important scientific information from the original text.

**Overall Assessment:**
Model 2 provides the most accurate and complete translation while maintaining A2 accessibility. Model 1 offers good simplification but loses some detail. Model 3, despite its simplicity, contains a factual inaccuracy that affects the scientific content.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for A2 level. Successfully simplifies complex phrases like ""hit the nail on the head"" to ""made some great points."" Maintains the core message about parental influence and teenage behavior.

Weaknesses: Changes ""waiting at a red light"" to ""driving,"" which alters the meaning and creates a safety concern. Omits the specific detail about ""waiting at a red light"" entirely. The phrase ""sit quietly"" is less precise than the original ""sit together in silence.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Preserves more of the original meaning by mentioning both cooking and driving contexts. Uses appropriate A2 vocabulary while maintaining accuracy. The phrase ""trying to do many things at the same time"" effectively captures the multitasking concept. Includes the planning aspect with ""They plan to meet.""

Weaknesses: Like Model 1, changes ""waiting at a red light"" to ""driving,"" which misrepresents the original context. The phrase ""said something true"" is slightly awkward compared to other options.

Strengths: Uses appropriate A2-level vocabulary and maintains clear sentence structure. The phrase ""hide the bad news"" effectively simplifies ""sugarcoating."" Successfully conveys the main message about the sandwich method's problems.

Weaknesses: The term ""meaningful"" may be slightly advanced for A2 level. Could have used simpler alternatives like ""useful"" or ""helpful.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Consistently uses simple vocabulary throughout, replacing ""positive"" with ""good"" for easier comprehension. The phrase ""make the bad ones seem better"" clearly explains the concept. Maintains good flow and readability.

Weaknesses: Uses ""praise"" which might be more challenging than necessary for A2 learners. The repetition of ""good"" and ""bad"" could have been varied slightly for better style.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses accessible vocabulary and clear sentence structures. The phrase ""make the bad news sound better"" effectively communicates the original meaning. Good use of transitional words like ""instead.""

Weaknesses: Repeats ""bad news"" twice, which creates some redundancy. The phrase ""less important"" is adequate but could have been more specific to the context.

**Overall Comparison:**
All three translations successfully simplify the complex original text to A2 level. Model 2 demonstrates the most consistent use of simple vocabulary throughout. Model 1 maintains good clarity but includes one potentially challenging term. Model 3 provides clear communication but has minor redundancy issues.

All translations preserve the core message about the sandwich feedback method and its potential problems, while making the content accessible to A2-level learners.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for A2 level. Successfully conveys the main message about autonomous weapons being dangerous.
Weaknesses: Omits the organization's name entirely. Loses the specific reference to ""Terminator"" and ""stamping on human skulls"" which provides important context. The term ""murderbots"" and concept of ""following orders but ultimately deciding"" is not translated, missing key information about the progression from current to future autonomous weapons.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains the organization's full name. Maintains the movie reference context with ""crushing skulls."" Uses vocabulary suitable for A2 level while preserving most key concepts. The phrase ""extremely careful"" appropriately intensifies the original's ""very cautious indeed.""
Weaknesses: The transition from current weapons to future autonomous ones could be clearer. Some nuance about ""following orders but ultimately deciding"" is lost.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes the organization's name. Clearly separates current military use from future possibilities with explicit structure (""what is happening now"" followed by ""Soon, there might be""). Uses simple, accessible language throughout. Makes the military context explicit.
Weaknesses: Completely removes the movie reference context (Terminator, skull crushing), which was important for the author's rhetorical strategy. The concept of robots ""following orders but ultimately deciding"" is not captured.

All three translations successfully simplify vocabulary and sentence structure for A2 level. Model 1 loses too much essential information. Models 2 and 3 both preserve core content well, but Model 2 maintains more of the original's rhetorical elements while Model 3 provides clearer logical structure.

However, there is a stronger connection between how many people learn a language and how many countries speak it.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the core meaning accurately and uses simpler sentence structures. The phrase ""all other languages together"" effectively simplifies ""the other languages combined.""
Weaknesses: Uses ""little connection"" which may be challenging for A2 learners. The final sentence structure remains somewhat complex with multiple clauses.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Breaks the first sentence into two shorter sentences, making it more digestible for A2 learners. Uses ""not much connection"" which is clearer than ""little connection."" Maintains all key information from the original.
Weaknesses: The word ""connection"" appears twice in close proximity, which could be repetitive. Some sentences still contain multiple clauses that may challenge A2 readers.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses the most accessible vocabulary by replacing ""native speakers"" with ""people who speak it as their first language,"" making the concept clearer for A2 learners. Breaks information into shorter, more manageable sentences. Uses ""not much connection"" consistently.
Weaknesses: The explanation ""people who speak it as their first language"" makes sentences longer and potentially more difficult to process. This verbosity may counteract the vocabulary simplification benefits.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three models successfully convey the original meaning and reduce complexity appropriately for A2 level. Model 2 achieves the best balance between simplification and clarity by using shorter sentences while maintaining accessible vocabulary. Model 1 preserves meaning well but retains some challenging elements. Model 3 attempts the most thorough vocabulary simplification but creates unnecessarily long explanations.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and sentence structures appropriate for A2 level. Successfully conveys the main points about spider venom purpose and the Sydney funnel-web spider example. The phrase ""shoot out tiny hairs"" is clear and accessible.

Weaknesses: Omits the information about anti-venom development in 1981. The phrase ""rub hairy spiders up the wrong way"" is simplified to just being ""threatened"" but loses some meaning. Does not mention that the hairs embed in skin/eyes, only that they ""irritate.""

**Model 2 Feedback:**
Strengths: Maintains all key information from the original text, including the anti-venom development detail. Uses A2-appropriate vocabulary while being comprehensive. Clearly explains the urticating hairs mechanism and their effects.

Weaknesses: Slightly longer sentences that may challenge A2 readers. The phrase ""annoying hairs"" is somewhat informal. Some sentences could be simplified further for the target level.

**Model 3 Feedback:**
Strengths: Covers all main points from the original text. Uses simple vocabulary and sentence structures. Effectively explains the tarantula defense mechanism and its effects on humans. Good use of ""itch or hurt"" to describe the hair effects.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""there is now medicine to help"" is less specific than mentioning anti-venom. Some sentences are at the upper limit of A2 complexity. Could benefit from slightly more detailed explanation of the anti-venom point.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for A2 level (""happy teenagers,"" ""shy,"" ""bravest""). The sentence structure is clear and accessible. Successfully conveys the main concept.

Weaknesses: Loses some specificity by changing ""cliché"" to ""idea"" and omitting ""especially popular."" Changes ""resourceful"" to ""smartest,"" which slightly alters the meaning. The phrase ""most resourceful person in the world"" becomes just ""smartest person,"" losing emphasis.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains good A2-level vocabulary while preserving more original meaning. Uses ""scary movie"" as an appropriate simplification. Keeps the time reference clear with ""late 1900s."" Adds ""quiet"" to describe the girl, which enhances understanding. Preserves ""almost always"" from the original.

Weaknesses: Uses ""there"" at the end of ""smartest person there,"" which is slightly awkward. Still changes ""resourceful"" to ""smartest.""

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Very similar to Model 2 with clear, simple language. Maintains the time reference and key plot elements. Uses appropriate A2 vocabulary throughout.

Weaknesses: Removes ""there"" from ""smartest person,"" which makes it less specific than the original ""in the world."" Like others, changes ""resourceful"" to ""smartest.""

**Comparison:**
All three models successfully simplify the text for A2 level. Models 2 and 3 are nearly identical, with Model 2 including ""there"" while Model 3 omits it. Model 1 is more concise but loses some detail. All models struggle with translating ""resourceful"" appropriately and change ""cliché"" to ""idea."" Models 2 and 3 better preserve the original structure and meaning while maintaining A2 accessibility.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and sentence structures appropriate for A2 level. Maintains clear paragraph structure. Successfully simplifies ""artefacts"" to ""objects"" and ""evolutionary biologists"" to ""scientists.""

Weaknesses: Omits the temporal aspect ""when and why they evolved that way"" from the original. The phrase ""why they developed that way"" is less precise than the original's meaning about evolutionary timing.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides clear explanations with A2-appropriate vocabulary. Effectively conveys the concept of brain evolution over time. Maintains the logical flow of the original text. Uses accessible language like ""changed over time"" instead of ""evolved.""

Weaknesses: Slightly repetitive with ""how it changed over time"" appearing twice in similar contexts. The phrase ""physical evidence"" might be marginally more complex than necessary for A2 level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very simple vocabulary and sentence structures. Adds helpful clarification ""like in their mouths, throats, and tongues"" which aids comprehension. The phrase ""talk to each other"" is more accessible than ""communicate"" for A2 learners.

Weaknesses: Changes ""artefacts"" to ""things,"" which is overly simplified and loses some meaning. The phrase ""changes in the bones"" is less accurate than the original's focus on anatomical development. Omits some nuance about the evolutionary process.

Furthermore, there is an unfortunate perception that scientists are geeky, have poor social skills or that their work is lonely and detached from the rest of the world.

Strengths: Clearly explains the society versus nature distinction. Uses accessible vocabulary while maintaining most key ideas. Includes the concept of career choice. Preserves the logical flow of the argument.
Weaknesses: Changes ""cartoons"" to a more general reference, losing some specificity. The phrase ""strange"" for ""geeky"" may not fully capture the original meaning. Some connecting words could be simpler for A2 level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very simple vocabulary suitable for A2 learners. Maintains the main argument structure. Changes ""cartoons"" to ""movies"" which may be more relatable. Clearly states that stereotypes are false.
Weaknesses: Loses the distinction between ""arts and humanities"" by only mentioning ""art and books."" Changes the ending to ""good job"" rather than addressing confidence and belonging, which reduces the psychological aspect of the original message.
