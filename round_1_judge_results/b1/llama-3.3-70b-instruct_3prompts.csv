Strengths:
- Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level
- Maintains the core message about dreams revealing unconscious thoughts
- Good sentence structure and flow

Weaknesses:
- Omits two important dream examples (teeth falling out, being naked in public)
- Loses some specificity from the original text
- The phrase ""things you didn't know you were thinking about"" is less precise than ""insights into things""

**Model 2 Feedback:**

Strengths:
- Includes all four dream examples from the original
- Uses accessible vocabulary while maintaining completeness
- Clear structure with logical flow
- Accurately conveys the connection between dreams and daily life

Weaknesses:
- ""Being naked in public"" is slightly more direct than the original's ""having no clothes on in a public place""
- Minor repetition with ""every day"" at the end

**Model 3 Feedback:**

Strengths:
- Includes all dream examples from the original text
- Uses appropriate B1-level vocabulary
- Maintains the meaning about connecting dreams to personal experiences
- Good sentence structure

Weaknesses:
- ""Being naked in public"" is more direct than the original phrasing
- The phrase ""think about how they relate to"" is slightly more complex than necessary for B1
- ""Every day"" at the end adds emphasis not present in the original

All three models successfully simplify the language for B1 level while preserving the main concepts. The key differentiator is completeness of content, with Models 2 and 3 retaining all dream examples while Model 1 omits half of them.

Strengths: Maintains clear sentence structure and uses simpler vocabulary appropriate for B1 level (""did not want anymore"" instead of ""abandoned""). The text flows well and preserves all key information from the original.

Weaknesses: Changes ""packs"" to ""groups"" which loses some specificity, though this may be intentional for B1 simplification. The grammar correction from ""are"" to ""is"" in the opening sentence is accurate.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains the term ""packs"" with explanation, which helps vocabulary building. Uses ""abandoned"" appropriately for B1 level. Includes helpful clarification (""called packs"") and maintains good sentence variety. Preserves the meaning about traffic lights effectively.

Weaknesses: Slightly more complex vocabulary choices that may challenge some B1 learners. The phrase ""what traffic lights mean"" is somewhat more complex than necessary.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary and maintains most of the original meaning. Sentence structure is generally clear and accessible.

Weaknesses: Contains a significant error - ""In, scientists studied"" is missing the year ""2010,"" creating an incomplete and confusing sentence. This is a factual omission that affects comprehension. The text is otherwise similar to Model 2 but with this critical flaw.

**Ranking Assessment:**
Model 1 provides the most consistent and error-free adaptation while maintaining appropriate B1 level language. Model 2 offers good vocabulary support but is slightly more complex. Model 3 contains a significant factual error that impacts readability and accuracy.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and sentence structures appropriate for B1 level. Successfully conveys the main points about the book's popularity and school usage.
Weaknesses: Omits that this is Palacio's first novel. Simplifies ""facial deformities"" to just ""looked different,"" losing some specificity. Reduces ""bestseller"" to just ""very popular."" The phrase ""being a good friend"" doesn't fully capture the concept of friendship discussions.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains most key information while using accessible language. Preserves the personal element ""including me."" Uses ""several awards"" which matches the original. Includes all three discussion topics mentioned in the original.
Weaknesses: ""Different face"" is somewhat awkward phrasing. Doesn't specify this is her first novel. Changes ""bestseller"" to ""very popular.""

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Clearly states this is Palacio's first book. Provides a more natural description of facial differences. Maintains ""several prizes"" (equivalent to awards). Preserves all three discussion topics with fuller explanation. Includes the personal perspective ""including me."" Uses ""based on the book"" which is more precise than other versions.
Weaknesses: The phrase ""different from most people's"" is slightly more complex than necessary for B1 level.

Weaknesses: Loses several important details from the original text, including the phrase ""lost count of the times,"" the concept of explaining ""patiently,"" and the specific mention that rats make ""fantastic pets if you look after them correctly.""

Strengths: Maintains more detail from the original while keeping language accessible. Preserves the idea of repeated explanations and includes the conditional aspect of proper pet care. Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary like ""take good care of them.""

Weaknesses: Omits the time reference ""last year"" and doesn't capture Chloe's patience in her explanations. The phrase ""feel the same way"" is somewhat less specific than the original's ""didn't like rats either.""

Strengths: Retains the most comprehensive information from the original, including the time reference ""last year."" Maintains the logical flow and includes key details about people's typical reactions. Uses varied sentence structures while remaining accessible.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""most people don't usually keep rats as pets"" slightly changes the meaning from ""not typical pets."" Some sentences are longer and more complex, which may push the upper boundaries of B1 level.

Strengths: Maintains the original meaning while adding helpful explanations (""electrocuted, which means they got a severe electric shock,"" ""urban areas, which are cities and towns""). Preserves important concepts like the endangered status and city council involvement.
Weaknesses: The added explanations make some sentences longer and potentially more complex than necessary for B1 level. Some phrases like ""to some extent"" might be challenging for B1 learners.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and sentence structures appropriate for B1 level. Clear cause-and-effect relationship between cheap clothes and disposal behavior. Good use of ""as a result"" to show consequences.

Weaknesses: Loses the impactful word ""bombard"" by simplifying to ""see,"" which reduces the intensity of the original message. The connection between online shopping and thoughtless purchasing is less clear than in the original.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the concept of constant exposure through ""constantly showing."" Preserves the original meaning about internet shopping enabling thoughtless purchases. Uses ""get rid of them"" as a natural alternative to ""thrown away.""

Weaknesses: Retains more complex vocabulary like ""consumers"" and ""constantly"" which may be challenging for B1 learners. The sentence structure remains quite similar to the original, potentially making it less accessible.

Strengths: Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary and maintains clear sentence structure. Preserves the key elements of the conflict and resolution. The phrase ""deal with the pigs in a more peaceful way"" effectively simplifies the original concept.

Weaknesses: Opens with ""Many people living in Berlin"" instead of ""city residents,"" which changes the specificity slightly. Otherwise maintains good fidelity to the original meaning.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three translations successfully adapt the text to B1 level while maintaining the core message. Model 2 provides the most complete information by including the context about population control. Model 3 maintains good balance between simplification and accuracy. Model 1, while clear, omits some contextual details that help readers understand the situation.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level. Successfully simplifies ""classical Greek mythology"" to ""Greek mythology"" and ""labyrinth"" to ""maze."" Maintains the core narrative structure and includes all key story elements.

Weaknesses: Changes ""futuristic Theseus"" to ""modern version of Theseus,"" which alters the meaning since the Hunger Games is set in a dystopian future, not the present. The phrase ""don't like being ruled"" is somewhat informal for the context.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides good contextual details like ""island of Crete"" and explains ""labyrinth"" as ""complicated maze."" Adds interpretive information about Katniss being ""a hero who fights against the system,"" which helps B1 readers understand the connection. Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary throughout.

Weaknesses: Changes ""seven boys and seven girls"" to ""14 young people,"" losing the specific gender balance mentioned in the original. The added interpretation, while helpful, goes beyond the source text.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the specific detail of ""seven boys and seven girls."" Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary and sentence structures. Preserves the original meaning closely while making it accessible. Includes helpful context like ""island of Crete.""

Weaknesses: Changes ""futuristic Theseus"" to ""hero from the past,"" which creates confusion since Theseus is the ancient hero, not Katniss. This significantly alters the intended meaning of the comparison.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and sentence structures appropriate for B1 level. Successfully simplifies complex concepts like ""conservation issues"" to ""protecting animals and their homes.""

Weaknesses: Omits the opening clause about bringing people and animals together, losing important context. The phrase ""make them healthy again"" is somewhat awkward and doesn't clearly convey treating illnesses. Lacks some connecting words that would improve flow.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains good B1-level vocabulary while preserving most original meaning. Uses appropriate connectors like ""Additionally"" and ""also."" Clearly explains the research aspect with ""studies on how animals behave.""

Weaknesses: Omits the opening concept about bringing people and animals together. The phrase ""make them healthy again when they are sick"" is slightly redundant and could be more concise.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level. Successfully conveys the main concept of the sharing economy. The phrase ""things they no longer need"" accurately captures the essence of underutilized items.

Weaknesses: Loses some precision from the original text. ""Things"" is used repeatedly, making the text less varied. The connection between underutilized items and profit generation is somewhat simplified.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains good vocabulary variety with ""valuable"" instead of just ""useful."" Preserves the term ""second-hand items"" from the original. The phrase ""made it possible"" effectively conveys the enabling role of the internet. Structure flows logically from problem to solution.

Weaknesses: Slightly less specific about social media groups compared to the original. The concept of ""peer-to-peer sharing"" is simplified to just ""sharing things with each other.""

Strengths: Uses ""valuable"" which is more precise than ""useful."" Maintains the concept of second-hand goods. Clear progression from unused items to profit-making opportunity. Good use of ""things they do not use"" which directly relates to underutilization.

Weaknesses: Starts abruptly without ""Some"" which makes the opening less smooth. Repetitive use of ""things"" throughout the text. The phrase ""sharing things they do not use"" is somewhat redundant.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three models successfully adapt the text to B1 level by using simpler vocabulary and shorter sentences. They maintain the core message about the sharing economy while making it accessible. Model 2 demonstrates the best balance of simplicity and precision, retaining more specific terminology while remaining clear. Model 1 provides good clarity but sacrifices some accuracy. Model 3 has good content but suffers from repetitive language and a less polished opening.

Strengths: Uses simple, accessible vocabulary appropriate for B1 level. The sentence structure is clear and straightforward. Successfully simplifies complex concepts without losing core meaning.

Weaknesses: Omits ""conscious mind"" entirely, which removes an important conceptual distinction. The phrase ""mix of random thoughts and images"" adds ""thoughts"" which wasn't in the original text about brain activity.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the original structure closely while adapting language for B1 level. Provides helpful explanation of ""conscious mind"" in parentheses. Uses appropriate transitional phrases like ""On the other hand.""

Weaknesses: The parenthetical explanation may be too explicit for B1 learners who could understand ""conscious mind"" in context. Slightly more complex sentence structures than typical B1 level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Preserves the original meaning most accurately. Maintains the contrast between theories with ""However"" and ""opposite."" Keeps important phrases like ""things we see in our dreams"" and ""sorting out memories and events.""

Weaknesses: Uses ""well-known"" instead of ""popular,"" which slightly changes meaning. Some sentences remain relatively complex for B1 level.

**Comparative Assessment:**
Model 1 achieves the strongest simplification for B1 level but sacrifices some conceptual accuracy. Model 2 provides good explanation but may over-explain simple concepts. Model 3 maintains the best fidelity to the original meaning while still adapting language appropriately.

'Fast fashion' is a type of cheap clothing that quickly goes out of style and is often poor quality, so people don't want to buy it second-hand. As a result, a lot of clothes end up in the bin, and charities often send the clothes they can't sell to other countries, which causes more economic and environmental problems.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for B1 level (""throwing away too many clothes,"" ""only popular for a short time""). Maintains clear sentence structure and logical flow.
Weaknesses: Loses the specific term ""disposable clothing problem"" which is important to the meaning. The phrase ""not good enough quality to be worn again"" doesn't capture the recycling concept from the original. Some nuance is lost in simplification.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains most of the original vocabulary and concepts, including ""disposable clothing,"" ""recycled,"" and ""discarded."" Maintains the sophisticated structure while remaining accessible. Preserves the distinction between recycling and second-hand purchasing.
Weaknesses: Uses some vocabulary that may be challenging for B1 level (""contributing,"" ""disposable,"" ""discarded""). The sentence structure remains quite complex in places.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides clear explanation of ""fast fashion"" as ""cheap clothing,"" making the concept accessible. Uses simple, concrete language (""end up in the bin""). Maintains good logical flow between ideas.
Weaknesses: The addition of ""cheap"" to describe fast fashion adds information not present in the original. ""End up in the bin"" is more colloquial than the original tone. Some precision is lost in the simplification process.

All three translations successfully convey the main message about charity donations not solving the clothing waste problem. Model 2 stays closest to the original meaning and vocabulary while remaining comprehensible. Model 3 provides good accessibility but adds interpretive elements. Model 1 simplifies effectively but loses some key concepts.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear vocabulary appropriate for B1 level. Maintains the core narrative structure and includes all key events. The sentence structure is straightforward and accessible.

Weaknesses: Loses some specific details like the exact temperature (45°C) and omits the explanation that ""all her food"" was carried. The phrase ""very hot weather"" is less precise than the original's specific temperature reference.

**Model 2 Feedback:**

Strengths: Retains the specific temperature detail (45°C) and provides helpful explanations for potentially difficult terms like ""glacier"" and ""sledge."" The vocabulary remains at B1 level while adding clarifying context. Maintains the chronological flow of events clearly.

Weaknesses: Adds explanatory phrases that weren't in the original text, which slightly changes the tone. The phrase ""big river of ice"" for glacier, while helpful, is somewhat simplified and not entirely accurate.

**Model 3 Feedback:**

Strengths: Preserves the specific temperature measurement and maintains good narrative flow. Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary while keeping most of the original's meaning intact. The phrase ""special sled"" provides helpful context for ""sledge.""

Weaknesses: Changes ""sledge"" to ""special sled"" which alters the original terminology. The opening phrase ""are not happy with just one exciting trip"" slightly shifts the tone from the original's ""not content with.""

All three translations successfully adapt the text to B1 level by simplifying complex vocabulary and sentence structures while maintaining the essential story elements. Model 2 provides the most comprehensive adaptation with helpful explanations, Model 3 maintains good balance between simplification and accuracy, while Model 1 offers the most straightforward approach but loses some specific details.

He paints pictures of people who are homeless in big cities to encourage people who live there to think about the issue of homelessness.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for B1 level. The core message is preserved and easily understood.
Weaknesses: Oversimplifies ""social issues and problems"" to just ""big problems,"" losing specificity. Omits that Paris is his home city. The phrase ""people who don't have homes"" is more awkward than ""homeless people.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains most original details including ""hometown"" and ""various social problems."" Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary while preserving meaning. Includes the concept of ""raising awareness.""
Weaknesses: ""Began his career"" adds information not in the original text. ""Large cities"" and ""city residents"" may be slightly more complex than necessary for B1 level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Preserves key details like ""hometown, Paris"" and maintains the distinction between ""social problems"" and ""homelessness."" Uses clear, accessible language. ""People who are homeless"" is a natural B1-appropriate alternative to ""homeless people.""
Weaknesses: ""Important social problems"" adds a qualifier not in the original. ""People who live there"" is slightly more wordy than ""residents.""

**Ranking Analysis:**
Model 3 best balances simplification with accuracy, maintaining essential details while using appropriate B1 language. Model 2 preserves more original content but uses slightly more complex structures. Model 1, while very simple, loses too much specificity and detail from the original text.

In São Paulo, Brazil, the city council has even let some graffiti artists paint on the city's metro trains.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and sentence structures appropriate for B1 level. The text is clear and easy to understand.
Weaknesses: Changes the meaning significantly - states governments ""want to stop artists from painting graffiti"" rather than ""encourage artists not to paint randomly."" Omits the concept of ""designated areas"" and loses the nuance that this is about redirecting rather than stopping graffiti. Uses ""subway trains"" instead of maintaining consistency with the original terminology.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the core meaning better than Model 1 by explaining the redirection concept with ""anywhere they want"" and ""special areas where artists can paint freely."" Includes helpful clarification with ""without any problems."" Uses appropriate B1-level vocabulary and sentence length.
Weaknesses: Still slightly misrepresents the original intent by focusing on ""stopping"" rather than ""encouraging."" Uses ""city government"" instead of ""city council,"" changing the specific governmental body mentioned.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Best preserves the original meaning by including ""without permission,"" which captures the concept of random/unauthorized graffiti. Maintains ""city council"" from the original text. Adds ""express themselves"" which appropriately explains the purpose at B1 level. Includes clear examples and explanatory phrases.
Weaknesses: Changes ""subway trains"" to ""metro trains,"" though this is a minor terminology difference that doesn't affect meaning significantly.

All three translations successfully simplify the language for B1 level, but they differ in accuracy to the original meaning. Model 3 most accurately conveys that governments are redirecting unauthorized graffiti to designated areas, while Models 1 and 2 frame it more as prohibition followed by accommodation.

This is meaningful to her because it shows how life is always changing, with things ending and new things starting.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level. Successfully simplifies complex concepts while maintaining the core meaning. The sentence structure is straightforward and accessible.

Weaknesses: Loses some specificity from the original text - ""pavements"" becomes the more general ""streets,"" and ""abandoned cars"" becomes ""old cars."" The phrase ""gets destroyed"" is slightly stronger than the original's more neutral tone about removal.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains good vocabulary level for B1 learners. Preserves ""abandoned vehicles"" which is closer to the original meaning. Includes the transitional phrase ""What's interesting about her work"" which helps with text flow. Provides specific examples of how art is removed (rain, city cleaners).

Weaknesses: ""Pavements"" is still generalized to ""streets."" The overall structure is slightly more complex than necessary for B1 level, particularly the sentence beginning with ""What's interesting...""

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very clear, accessible language. The phrase ""cars that are no longer used"" effectively explains ""abandoned cars"" for B1 learners. Maintains the key concept about the temporary nature of street art. The word ""meaningful"" appropriately conveys the artist's connection to impermanence.

Weaknesses: Similar to others, ""pavements"" becomes ""streets."" The phrase ""erased by the weather"" is less natural than other options. Some sentences are slightly longer than optimal for B1 level.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three translations successfully adapt the text for B1 level by using simpler vocabulary and sentence structures. They maintain the essential meaning about Faith47's art practice and philosophy. The main differences lie in word choice precision and sentence complexity. Each translation handles the concept of temporary art appropriately, though with varying degrees of natural expression.

The plan is for DART to crash into 'Didymoon' and change its path enough that telescopes on Earth can notice the difference.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for B1 level. Successfully conveys the basic concept of the mission.
Weaknesses: Omits the full name ""Double Asteroid Redirection Test."" Uses informal language like ""bigger rock"" which loses technical accuracy. The phrase ""might be able to see it"" is imprecise - the original refers to detecting orbital changes, not visual observation.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes the complete acronym explanation. Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary while maintaining technical accuracy. Clearly explains the relationship between the asteroids. The phrase ""notice the change"" accurately reflects the original meaning.
Weaknesses: Uses ""diameter"" which may be slightly advanced for B1 level compared to ""wide."" The sentence structure is somewhat more complex than typical B1 level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides the full acronym explanation. Uses clear, accessible language. Maintains good technical accuracy while simplifying vocabulary. The phrase ""notice the difference"" effectively conveys the original meaning.
Weaknesses: Minor redundancy in ""also known as"" when 'Didymoon' was already introduced as a nickname in the original context.

**Comparison:**
All three models successfully simplify the original text for B1 level. Model 1 uses the simplest language but sacrifices some accuracy and completeness. Models 2 and 3 both retain important technical information while remaining accessible. Model 2 uses slightly more sophisticated vocabulary, while Model 3 maintains similar clarity with more consistent word choice (using ""wide"" throughout rather than mixing ""diameter"" and ""wide"").

Strengths:
- Uses simple, clear sentence structures appropriate for B1 level
- Maintains all key plot points from the original
- Simplifies ""heroine"" to ""main character"" effectively
- Uses accessible vocabulary throughout

Weaknesses:
- Changes ""volunteers"" to ""decides,"" losing the specific meaning of voluntary sacrifice
- Refers to the Hunger Games as simply ""a dangerous game,"" which oversimplifies the concept
- Alters ""complicated relationship"" to ""complicated feelings,"" changing the meaning from mutual interaction to one-sided emotion
- Uses very short, choppy sentences that may seem overly simplified

**Model 2 Analysis:**

Strengths:
- Maintains appropriate B1 vocabulary while preserving more original meaning
- Keeps ""volunteers"" concept with ""decides to go instead""
- Provides better context by mentioning District 12 as her home location
- Adds explanatory phrase ""which makes things difficult for her"" to aid comprehension
- Balances simplification with content retention

Weaknesses:
- Still reduces the Hunger Games to ""dangerous game""
- Changes ""relationship"" to ""feelings,"" losing the reciprocal nature
- Slightly longer sentences may challenge some B1 learners

**Model 3 Analysis:**

Strengths:
- Preserves most original vocabulary while remaining accessible
- Maintains the reciprocal nature with ""Katniss starts to have complicated feelings for him""
- Uses ""take part"" consistently for participation
- Combines sentences effectively to maintain flow
- Keeps essential details like ""younger sister""

Weaknesses:
- Still simplifies Hunger Games to ""dangerous game""
- Uses ""decides to go instead"" rather than capturing the volunteering concept
- Some sentence structures approach upper B1 complexity

All models successfully simplify the tribute selection process and hunting skills description. Each reduces ""heroine"" to ""main character"" and maintains the core narrative elements. The main differences lie in sentence complexity, vocabulary choices, and how well they preserve the original meaning while achieving B1 accessibility.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level. Maintains the core message about dream journaling and connecting dreams to daily life. The sentence structure is straightforward and accessible.

Weaknesses: Omits the reference to ""feelings"" from daily life, which reduces the completeness of the advice. The phrase ""link your dreams to things that happen"" is somewhat vague compared to the original's ""events and feelings.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes both ""things that happen and how you feel,"" which captures the original's mention of both events and feelings. Uses ""writing down"" which is more specific than just ""writing about."" The language remains at B1 level while being comprehensive.

Weaknesses: The transition word ""Then"" at the beginning of the last sentence creates a slightly awkward flow. Minor issue with maintaining natural sentence rhythm.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides the most complete explanation by including ""because they can help you understand what they mean,"" which captures the original's reference to meaning. Uses ""see how your dreams are connected"" which effectively conveys the relationship concept. Includes both events and feelings like the original.

Weaknesses: Slightly more complex sentence structure in some parts, though still within B1 range. The explanation about meaning adds helpful context but makes the text marginally longer.

Strengths: Uses simple sentence structure appropriate for B1 level. The vocabulary is accessible and clear. Successfully breaks down complex ideas into digestible parts.
Weaknesses: Loses some important details from the original text, such as the specific mention that this was ""particularly true"" rather than just ""a big problem."" The phrase ""burn to the ground"" is simplified to just ""destroy it,"" losing some descriptive detail.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains most of the original meaning while using B1-appropriate vocabulary. Provides good detail about the spark creation process. The sentence structure flows well and explains the cause-and-effect relationship clearly.
Weaknesses: The phrase ""burn completely"" is slightly less vivid than the original ""burn to the ground."" Some sentences could be considered slightly complex for B1 level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Preserves the comparative aspect with ""more likely to catch fire"" and maintains the ""especially true"" phrasing from the original. Uses clear B1-level vocabulary while keeping most original details. The sentence structure is appropriate for the level.
Weaknesses: Changes ""more bridges"" to ""most bridges,"" which alters the meaning slightly. The single long sentence structure might be challenging for some B1 learners.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for B1 level. The core message is preserved and easily understood.
Weaknesses: Loses some nuance from the original text, such as ""certain trends are emerging"" becomes just ""some things are changing."" The phrase ""legitimate art form"" is simplified to ""real kind of art"" which changes the meaning slightly. Some connections between ideas are lost, making the text feel more fragmented.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains good vocabulary level for B1 while preserving most of the original meaning. Uses appropriate transitional words like ""additionally"" and ""even though."" The concept of ""valuable form of art"" effectively conveys the legitimacy aspect.
Weaknesses: Adds interpretation not present in the original (""important part of our culture"") which goes beyond the source text. Some phrases like ""real and valuable"" may be slightly above basic B1 level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Closely follows the original structure and meaning. Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary while maintaining the logical flow of ideas. Preserves key concepts like ""impossible to predict"" and ""valid form of art."" Maintains the original's balance between uncertainty and emerging trends.
Weaknesses: Like Model 2, adds interpretive content about street art being ""an important part of our culture"" that wasn't in the original. The phrase ""valid form of art"" might be slightly challenging for B1 learners.

**Overall Assessment:**
Model 1 provides the most accessible language but sacrifices meaning and coherence. Model 2 maintains good comprehensibility while preserving most content but adds unnecessary interpretation. Model 3 best balances fidelity to the original with appropriate B1 language level, though it also includes some added interpretation.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level with short sentences. Vocabulary is accessible (upset, scary, little girl). Successfully conveys the main narrative points.

Weaknesses: Oversimplifies the text significantly. Changes ""has always found"" to present tense ""doesn't like,"" losing the temporal aspect. ""Keep her safe"" misrepresents the mother's protective intent, which was specifically about information, not physical safety.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains appropriate B1 vocabulary while preserving the original's meaning well. ""Shield her from the truth"" accurately captures the mother's intent. Keeps the past tense structure effectively.

Weaknesses: ""Disturbing"" may be slightly more complex than necessary for B1 level. ""Involved"" is somewhat vague compared to the original's specificity about the father being ""there.""

Strengths: Uses very simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for B1 level. The information is clearly presented and easy to understand.
Weaknesses: Loses important technical details like ""1km wide"" and ""planetary defence team."" The term ""big rocks"" is overly simplified and less precise than ""asteroids."" Omits the specific measurement criteria and the concept of Earth's orbit.

**Model 2 Feedback:**
Strengths: Retains all key technical information including ""1km wide"" and explains the planetary defence concept. Maintains the NEO acronym with explanation. Provides accurate translation of ""Earth's orbit"" as ""Earth's path around the sun."" Preserves the numerical data accurately.
Weaknesses: Some sentences are relatively long for B1 level, which may challenge comprehension.

**Model 3 Feedback:**
Strengths: Includes all essential technical details and maintains scientific accuracy. Uses clear explanations like ""Earth's path around the sun."" Retains important numerical information and the NEO concept. Sentence structure is generally appropriate for B1 level.
Weaknesses: Very similar to Model 2 with only minor wording differences. Some sentences could be shorter for optimal B1 comprehension.

**Ranking Analysis:**
Model 2 and Model 3 are nearly identical, both preserving crucial technical information while maintaining B1-appropriate language. Model 1, while simpler, sacrifices too much important content. Between Models 2 and 3, Model 2 uses slightly more natural phrasing in some instances.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level. Successfully simplifies complex phrases like ""agonising experience"" to ""more nervous"" and ""intense ups and downs"" to ""good and bad days."" The sentence structure is straightforward and accessible.

Weaknesses: Loses some important nuances from the original text. The phrase ""when he's not looking"" changes the meaning from the original ""behind their hands."" Omits the specific reference to ""the plague"" concept, which is significant to the story. The ending feels somewhat abrupt and less impactful.

**Model 2 Feedback:**

Strengths: Maintains most of the original meaning while adapting language for B1 level. Preserves important details like ""the plague"" reference and explains the classmates' fear clearly. The narrative flow remains coherent and engaging. Successfully adapts ""agonising"" to ""even more difficult.""

Weaknesses: Some phrases like ""serious illness"" might be slightly above B1 level. The text is longer than necessary for the target level, which could challenge B1 readers. The phrase ""when they think he's not listening"" slightly alters the original meaning.

**Model 3 Feedback:**

Strengths: Keeps the original sentence structure in the opening, which maintains the text's flow. Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary substitutions like ""appearance"" for ""the way he looks"" and ""looking at him"" for ""staring."" Preserves the dramatic impact of the ending.

Weaknesses: Retains some complex structures that may challenge B1 readers, such as ""Having decided to go to school"" in the opening.

Strengths: Retains more descriptive language while keeping it accessible (""seemed to go on forever""). Includes the rebellious aspect as ""want to run away."" Maintains the contrast between good riders and inexperienced riders clearly. Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary throughout.

Weaknesses: ""Property"" remains unchanged, which may be challenging for B1 learners. The text becomes longer than necessary in some places. ""Big feet"" instead of ""hooves"" loses some precision.

**Model 3 Feedback:**

Strengths: Preserves the descriptive phrase ""went on and on as far as they could see"" in simple language. Uses ""naughty"" as an appropriate B1 substitute for ""rebellious."" Maintains the uncertainty with ""maybe"" in the final sentence. Good use of ""spot"" as a synonym for ""see.""

Weaknesses: ""Property"" becomes ""land"" but could still be clearer. The phrase ""no matter how"" might be slightly complex for B1 level. Uses ""big feet"" instead of maintaining horse-specific terminology.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for B1 level (""groups"" instead of ""packs,"" ""underground trains"" instead of ""metro system""). The sentence structure is clear and accessible. Successfully maintains the core meaning while simplifying complex phrases.

Weaknesses: Loses some specificity by changing ""excellent sense of smell"" to just ""good sense of smell."" The phrase ""recognize the places they like"" is less precise than the original ""scents of their favourite destinations."" The ending omits the specific mention of locals, which changes the meaning slightly.

**Model 2 Analysis:**

Strengths: Maintains more of the original structure while keeping language accessible. Uses ""strong sense of smell"" which better preserves the original meaning than Model 1. Keeps the phrase ""more likely to give food"" which maintains the original's precision. Uses ""underground train system"" which is clear for B1 learners.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""places they like to go"" is somewhat informal. The ending ""very used to"" adds an unnecessary intensifier. Some repetition in the final sentence structure could be smoother.

**Model 3 Analysis:**

Strengths: Best preserves the original meaning and structure while maintaining B1 accessibility. Keeps ""have learned to recognize"" which maintains the original's emphasis on learning. The phrase ""that they hear announced"" closely mirrors the original ""they hear in announcements."" Successfully maintains the distinction about locals in the final sentence.

Weaknesses: The ending phrase ""especially the locals"" is slightly awkward and doesn't perfectly capture the original meaning that locals are the ones who don't notice them. Minor redundancy with ""trains"" repeated in the last sentence.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and sentence structures appropriate for B1 level. The information is clear and accessible.
Weaknesses: Loses some specificity from the original text, such as omitting ""small stream"" and ""rainforest."" The phrase ""but that was all"" oversimplifies the severity of thousands of bites.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains most key details from the original, including the complete journey concept (""entire Amazon River""). Uses appropriate B1-level vocabulary while preserving important information.
Weaknesses: The phrase ""bitten by mosquitoes and ants thousands of times"" creates an awkward repetition issue and changes the meaning slightly from the original's ""few thousand mosquito and ant bites.""

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Preserves nearly all original details including ""small stream,"" ""rainforest,"" and maintains the temporal structure of the sentence. Uses appropriate vocabulary for B1 level while keeping the text comprehensive.
Weaknesses: The phrase ""stayed alive"" is slightly more dramatic than the original's ""survived,"" though this is a minor deviation.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level. Maintains the core message about overspending and waste. The phrase ""money they don't have"" effectively simplifies the credit concept.

Weaknesses: Omits the specific percentage of income (4%), loses the precise statistic about 66% of wardrobe budget, and removes the explanation of ""landfill sites."" The structure is less organized than the original, combining ideas without clear transitions.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains most key statistics including the 4% income figure. Provides helpful explanation of ""landfill sites"" which aids B1 comprehension. Maintains clear structure with ""Firstly"" and ""Secondly"" transitions. Preserves the logical flow of the original argument.

Weaknesses: Omits the specific ""66 per cent of the average wardrobe budget"" statistic. Slightly longer than necessary for B1 level with some redundant phrasing.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes all major statistics (4%, £670, 66%). Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary while maintaining precision. Keeps the logical structure with clear transitions using ""Firstly"" and ""Also.""

Weaknesses: Uses ""waste sites"" instead of ""landfill sites,"" which is less specific and potentially confusing. The phrase ""goes to waste sites"" is less clear than explaining what landfill sites are.

**Overall Assessment:**
Model 2 provides the most comprehensive adaptation for B1 learners by including helpful explanations while maintaining most key information. Model 3 preserves more statistical detail but sacrifices clarity with ""waste sites."" Model 1 simplifies effectively but loses too much important information.

Strengths:
- Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level
- Maintains the core meaning of the original text
- Simplifies complex phrases effectively (e.g., ""wrote about his daily experiences on the internet"" instead of ""wrote a blog"")

Weaknesses:
- Changes the conditional structure ""would have been impossible"" to ""was only possible,"" altering the original meaning
- Loses the phrase ""most difficult terrain,"" replacing it with the vaguer ""difficult parts""
- Oversimplifies ""media interest"" to just ""interest,"" losing specificity
- Uses ""talk about the problems"" instead of ""protest about the destruction,"" weakening the activist tone

**Model 2 Analysis:**

Strengths:
- Preserves the original conditional structure accurately
- Maintains appropriate B1 vocabulary while keeping meaning intact
- Uses ""navigate through the toughest parts"" which effectively conveys the original meaning
- Keeps the activist tone with ""speak out against""

Weaknesses:
- Uses ""collect money"" instead of ""raise money,"" which is less natural in this context
- ""Contact"" might be slightly more formal than necessary for B1 level

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for B1 level. Maintains the core message about relationships and happiness. Removes complex terms like ""self-disclosure"" which may be difficult for B1 learners.

Weaknesses: Omits the reference to the study, which provides important context. Loses the specific mention of ""network of other relationships"" and the examples of casual topics (music, football). The phrase ""feel close to someone"" is somewhat vague compared to the original's more specific explanation.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains the study reference and keeps the term ""self-disclosure"" with a clear explanation. Maintains most key concepts including the distinction between deep and casual friendships. Uses accessible vocabulary while preserving important details.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""a few other friends"" is less precise than the original's ""network of other relationships."" Changes ""music or football"" to ""hobbies,"" which is more general but loses the concrete examples that aid comprehension.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and sentence structures appropriate for B1 level. The core message about praising process over results is clearly conveyed.
Weaknesses: Omits the 'growth mindset' concept entirely, which is central to the original text. The phrase ""brain plasticity"" is oversimplified to just ""brains can change."" Some nuance is lost, such as the distinction between developing new skills versus improving existing ones.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains the 'growth mindset' terminology while keeping language accessible. Maintains the key contrast between praising natural talents versus praising process. Vocabulary remains at B1 level while preserving more of the original meaning.
Weaknesses: The phrase ""paying attention to details"" slightly changes the meaning from ""having an eye for details."" Some of the original's emphasis on experimentation is reduced.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Most comprehensive retention of original concepts, including 'growth mindset' and the full range of strategies (effort, experimentation, problem-solving). Provides the clearest explanation of the research findings. Maintains the distinction between natural abilities and developed skills.
Weaknesses: Slightly more complex sentence structures that may challenge some B1 learners. The final sentence becomes somewhat lengthy for the target level. Uses ""willingness to try new things"" instead of ""experimentation,"" which is less precise.

Weaknesses: Loses the key concept of ""evolution as a species"" by omitting it entirely. ""Audiovisual perception"" is oversimplified to just ""seeing and hearing things"" without conveying the enhancement aspect. The phrase ""This idea will become normal soon"" changes the meaning from a gradual process to an immediate one.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains the core concept of human species development. Maintains the progressive nature of the idea with ""more and more normal."" Uses ""computer chip"" which is more concrete than the abstract ""computer."" Preserves the enhancement aspect with ""better at,"" ""more clearly,"" and ""more easily.""
Weaknesses: ""Speed up the way humans develop"" is slightly awkward phrasing. The sentence structure becomes somewhat complex for B1 level in places.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Successfully conveys the species development concept. Uses accessible vocabulary while maintaining technical accuracy with ""adding technology to our bodies."" Preserves the original meaning of gradual acceptance. Maintains parallel structure in listing the improvements.
Weaknesses: Shifts from ""our brain"" to ""your brain,"" creating inconsistency in perspective. ""Remember information"" is slightly more formal than necessary for B1 level.

**Ranking Analysis:**
Model 2 provides the most complete translation while staying within B1 parameters. Model 3 follows closely but has the perspective inconsistency issue. Model 1, while simple and clear, omits too much essential meaning from the original text.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level. Successfully conveys the main ideas about parental influence and teenagers switching between online and offline interactions.
Weaknesses: Loses some specificity from the original text, such as the specific examples of parents using phones while cooking or at red lights. The phrase ""said some very true things"" is less precise than the original idiom. Omits the detail about social media posting.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains most of the original content and examples, including the specific scenarios of cooking dinner and waiting at traffic lights. Uses accessible vocabulary while preserving the meaning. Good use of transitional phrases like ""for example"" and ""this means.""
Weaknesses: The phrase ""absolutely right"" may be slightly advanced for B1 level. Some sentences are relatively long and complex for the target level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Preserves key details like cooking dinner and traffic lights. Maintains the reference to the speaker as ""she."" Uses clear, straightforward language. Good balance between simplification and content retention.
Weaknesses: The sentence structure in some parts could be simplified further for B1 level. The dash used in the final sentence might be considered slightly advanced punctuation for this level.

All three models successfully avoid the idiomatic expression ""hit the nail on the head"" and replace it with more accessible language. They all maintain the core message about parental influence and teenagers' behavior patterns. Model 2 provides the most comprehensive coverage of the original content, while Model 1 offers the simplest language structure. Model 3 strikes a reasonable balance between the two approaches.

Strengths: Uses clear, simple language appropriate for B1 level. Maintains good flow and readability. Accurately conveys the main statistical information and overall message about decreasing violence.

Weaknesses: Omits the specific timeframe ""until 1990"" for the 30 wars. Loses the nuanced comparison between violent crime and political conflict deaths (simplifies ""nine times more likely"" to just ""more likely"").

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful clarifications like ""which ended in 1945"" and defines civilians as ""ordinary people, not soldiers."" Maintains all key statistical information including the ""nine times more likely"" detail. Uses accessible vocabulary while preserving accuracy.

Weaknesses: Slightly longer than necessary for B1 level. The parenthetical explanations, while helpful, add length that might challenge B1 readers.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level. Successfully conveys the main ideas about Wasfia's work and her combination of mountaineering with human rights advocacy.
Weaknesses: Loses some specificity by changing ""international humanitarian projects"" to just ""projects."" The phrase ""doing the trick"" is retained, which may be too idiomatic for B1 learners. Omits that Bangladesh is coastal, which provides important geographical context.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains clear structure and explicitly names Bangladesh early in the text. Effectively explains the geographical contrast between Bangladesh and mountainous regions. Uses accessible vocabulary while preserving the core message.
Weaknesses: Changes ""witnessed"" to ""seen,"" which slightly alters the meaning and loses some of the original's impact. The phrase ""take care of itself"" is somewhat simplified compared to ""stand up for itself.""

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level. Maintains the core message and statistics accurately. The phrase ""are no longer poor"" effectively simplifies ""come out of poverty.""

Weaknesses: ""Big changes are happening"" loses some impact compared to ""great transformation."" The ending feels slightly abrupt with ""many people have clean water"" being less specific than the original's ""millions of people.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains good flow with appropriate conjunctions. Uses ""escaped poverty"" which is slightly more sophisticated while remaining B1-appropriate. Includes ""now have clean water"" which adds temporal context.

Weaknesses: ""Big change"" (singular) doesn't capture the scope of ""great transformation"" as well as ""big changes"" (plural). Otherwise very similar to Model 1 with minor improvements.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: ""Unfair leaders"" is more accessible than ""dictators"" for B1 learners. Adds helpful detail with ""clean water to drink"" making the concept clearer. Includes ""many more girls"" which better reflects the original's emphasis.

Weaknesses: ""Life in developing countries is very bad"" changes the focus from the countries themselves to life within them, which slightly alters the meaning. The phrase structure is sometimes less natural.

**Overall Comparison:**
All three models successfully simplify vocabulary and sentence structure for B1 level. Model 2 has the smoothest flow and most natural phrasing.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for B1 level and maintains clear sentence structure. The core message about the sandwich method's problems is conveyed.
Weaknesses: Contains a significant factual error - describes putting ""a negative comment between two positive ones"" when the original describes putting negative feedback between positive comments (the opposite arrangement). This misrepresents the sandwich feedback method entirely.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses appropriate B1-level vocabulary and sentence complexity. Maintains the correct structure of the sandwich method (negative between positive comments). Preserves the main argument about diminished value of positive feedback.
Weaknesses: The phrase ""sound less bad"" is somewhat informal and could be expressed more clearly. The translation is accurate but lacks some nuance from the original.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides the clearest explanation of the sandwich method using simple, sequential language (""something good, then something bad, and then something good again""). Uses very accessible vocabulary throughout. Explains the consequences in concrete terms (""don't take the positive comments seriously""). The final sentence effectively captures both purposes of positive feedback.
Weaknesses: Slightly more verbose than necessary. The phrase ""less painful"" adds emotional language not present in the original.

Model 1 contains a fundamental factual error that reverses the sandwich method concept. Model 2 provides an accurate but somewhat basic translation. Model 3 offers the most comprehensive and understandable explanation while maintaining accuracy, though it adds some interpretive elements.

It's easy to think that the artist is writing about real people he knows and the life he could have had if he wasn't a famous musician. This album clearly shows the special and amazing talent of the artist, known as the Boss.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level. Successfully conveys the main contrast between upbeat music and serious lyrics. The vocabulary is accessible and sentence structures are straightforward.

Weaknesses: Loses the album title ""Born in the USA"" entirely. Omits the specific phrase ""American dream"" which is culturally significant. The phrase ""fast and fun"" oversimplifies ""fast-paced, foot-tapping."" Some nuanced expressions like ""had the world at their feet"" are reduced to basic terms.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains the album title and maintains good structural flow. Preserves key concepts like ""high-energy"" and ""catchy melodies."" Successfully explains the contrast between sound and content. Includes most story details from both songs mentioned.

Weaknesses: Uses ""amazing talent"" which elevates the language beyond necessary B1 simplification. The phrase ""make you want to move your feet"" is more complex than the original ""foot-tapping."" Some sentences remain quite long for B1 level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Keeps the album title and maintains the American dream reference. Uses ""emotionally deep"" as a good B1 alternative to ""emotional weight."" Preserves the cultural context well and includes most key narrative elements.

Weaknesses: ""Music collection"" is an awkward replacement for ""album."" Uses ""amazing talent"" like Model 2. The phrase ""exciting music"" doesn't capture the specific rock genre emphasis. Some sentence structures could be simpler for B1 level.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three models successfully simplify vocabulary and sentence structures while maintaining the core message about contrasting upbeat music with serious social commentary. Model 1 achieves the clearest B1-appropriate language but sacrifices important content. Models 2 and 3 retain more original content but use some unnecessarily complex expressions.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level. Successfully conveys the main message about societal influence versus nature. The sentence structure is straightforward and accessible.

Weaknesses: Oversimplifies several key concepts. ""Strange"" and ""shy"" don't fully capture the original stereotypes of ""geeky"" and ""poor social skills."" Omits important details like the media's role in perpetuating stereotypes and the concept of career appeal. The phrase ""look up to"" may be too idiomatic for B1 level.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains most of the original content while using B1-appropriate vocabulary. Successfully explains the media's role in spreading false stereotypes. Preserves the logical flow and cause-effect relationships from the original text.

Weaknesses: Some phrases like ""the way society works"" and ""as a result"" might be slightly complex for B1 level. The sentence about media showing false ideas could be clearer in its connection to the previous statement.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Effectively balances content retention with B1 accessibility. Uses clear vocabulary substitutions like ""clever"" for ""genius"" and ""boring and separate"" for ""lonely and detached."" Maintains the original's structure while simplifying complex ideas appropriately.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""look up to"" appears twice, which may be repetitive and potentially challenging for B1 learners. Some sentences are relatively long, which could impact comprehension at this level.

All three translations successfully convey the core message about societal influence on gender stereotypes in science education. Model 1 prioritizes simplicity but loses some content depth. Model 2 retains more original content but uses slightly more complex language structures. Model 3 achieves a good balance between content preservation and B1-appropriate simplification.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level. Maintains all key information from the original text. Sentence structure is straightforward and accessible.
Weaknesses: Omits the survey reference entirely. ""Fun"" is a somewhat informal simplification of ""entertainment."" The environmental issue explanation is less detailed than the original.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes the survey reference which Model 1 missed. Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary while maintaining meaning. Clearly explains the environmental problem with specific mention of litter.
Weaknesses: ""Learning about culture"" is slightly awkward phrasing compared to ""cultural enrichment."" The phrase ""on their own"" adds unnecessary words.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Most comprehensive translation that includes all original elements. Maintains the survey reference and provides complete information. Uses ""really value"" which effectively conveys the strength of appreciation. Clearly structures the problems with ""However"" and ""Another problem.""
Weaknesses: Slightly longer sentences that approach the upper limit of B1 complexity. ""The whole newspaper themselves"" contains minor redundancy.

All three models successfully adapt the vocabulary to B1 level and maintain the core message. Each handles the technical aspects (weekly publication, free distribution, student production) accurately. The main differences lie in completeness of information transfer and clarity of expression.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and clear sentence structure appropriate for B1 level. Successfully converts ""employee turnover"" to ""employees leave their jobs,"" making the concept more accessible. The phrase ""not happy at work"" is straightforward and understandable.

Weaknesses: Loses the nuance of ""employee engagement"" by oversimplifying it to just happiness. Omits the comparative context (""Although this might not seem high at first glance"") which provides important perspective. The translation is somewhat less precise than the original.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains good balance between simplification and accuracy. Preserves the concept of employee involvement alongside happiness. Uses clear, accessible language while retaining most of the original meaning. The structure flows logically.

Weaknesses: Uses percentage symbols (%) instead of spelling out ""per cent,"" which may be less consistent with B1 writing conventions. Slightly reduces the explanatory context about industry comparison.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains the comparative context from the original (""This might not seem like a lot, but...""), which helps readers understand the significance. Maintains the industry comparison effectively. Uses appropriate B1-level vocabulary while preserving meaning.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""are or are not happy with their jobs"" is somewhat awkward and could be clearer. The sentence structure becomes slightly convoluted in places, potentially making it harder for B1 learners to follow.

**Ranking:**
All three translations successfully adapt the text to B1 level, but they differ in their balance of simplification and accuracy. Model 2 provides the clearest and most natural-sounding translation while maintaining essential meaning. Model 3 preserves more context but sacrifices some clarity. Model 1 is the most simplified but loses important nuances.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level. Successfully conveys the main ideas about generational differences and technology's impact. The phrase ""younger people are different"" effectively replaces the idiomatic ""another kettle of fish.""

Weaknesses: Loses some nuance from the original text. The phrase ""So much of what the speaker said rang true"" is simplified to just ""made some good points,"" reducing the emphasis. The concept of ""solitude"" and ""real time"" conversation is not fully captured.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains more detail from the original while keeping language accessible. Clearly explains the contrast between generations and preserves the key concepts about edited messages versus real-time conversation. The explanation of face-to-face conversation ""in the moment"" effectively conveys the original meaning.

Weaknesses: Slightly longer and more complex than typical B1 level. Some sentences contain multiple clauses that might challenge B1 readers. The phrase ""which is an important skill"" adds interpretation not present in the original.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Balances simplification with content retention. Uses clear, straightforward language while preserving the main arguments. The structure flows logically and maintains the generational comparison effectively.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""my age group"" is less personal than the original ""my generation."" Ends somewhat abruptly compared to the original's more complete thought about real-time conversation skills. Some of the emphasis from ""honestly believe"" and ""so much"" is lost.

All three translations successfully adapt the idiomatic expression ""another kettle of fish"" and make the content accessible to B1 learners. Model 2 provides the most comprehensive coverage of the original content, while Model 1 offers the clearest simplification, and Model 3 strikes a middle ground.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for B1 level (""good comments,"" ""bad comments,"" ""urge""). The sentence structure is straightforward and accessible. Successfully conveys the core message about not always pairing positive and negative feedback.

Weaknesses: Loses some nuance from the original text. The phrase ""won't mean much"" is less precise than ""devalued and ignored."" The final sentence structure is somewhat awkward with ""when you're saying something positive.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains clear B1-level vocabulary while preserving more of the original meaning. The explanation ""people might start to ignore the good ones"" effectively captures the concept of devaluation. Includes helpful elaboration with ""This way, people will appreciate the good comments more.""

Weaknesses: Slightly longer than necessary for B1 level. The added explanation, while helpful, wasn't present in the original text.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary and maintains the key concepts from the original. The phrase ""just because something is good"" effectively simplifies ""for its own sake."" Preserves the distinction between positive feedback and criticism.

Weaknesses: The opening phrase ""Don't always give negative comments after positive ones"" slightly alters the original meaning, which focused on following positive with negative, not the reverse.

**Ranking Analysis:**
Model 2 provides the most accurate translation while maintaining B1 accessibility. It preserves the original meaning most faithfully and includes clear explanations. Model 3 follows closely with good vocabulary choices and concept retention, though it has a minor meaning shift. Model 1, while simple and clear, loses more of the original nuance and precision.
