Dreams can tell you things about what you're thinking and feeling, even if you don't know it. Many people have similar dreams, like flying, falling, losing teeth, or being naked in public. These dreams usually have a common meaning. But to understand what *your* dreams mean, think about what's happening in your life and how you feel each day.

Dreams can tell you things about yourself that you don’t even know you’re thinking about. Many people have similar dreams, like flying, falling, losing teeth, or being naked in public. These dreams probably have a similar meaning for most people. However, to understand what your dreams mean *to you*, you need to think about what’s happening in your life and how you’re feeling. Connecting your dreams to your everyday experiences is the most important thing.



","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Successfully simplifies the original text while maintaining all key concepts. Uses appropriate B1-level vocabulary and sentence structures. The phrase ""think about what's happening in your life and how you feel each day"" effectively conveys the original's advice about connecting dreams to daily experiences.

Weaknesses: The transition between ideas could be smoother. The phrase ""these dreams usually have a common meaning"" is slightly less precise than the original's nuance about dreams meaning ""something similar.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Good vocabulary choices for B1 level. The phrase ""thoughts you didn't even know you had"" is a clear simplification of the original concept. Uses appropriate examples and maintains the core message about common dream types.

Weaknesses: The text is incomplete, ending abruptly mid-sentence with ""However, to understand what a dream *really* means."" This makes it impossible to evaluate how well it handles the crucial final concept about connecting dreams to personal experiences.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides the most complete coverage of the original text's ideas. Successfully simplifies complex concepts while retaining nuance. The final sentence ""Connecting your dreams to your everyday experiences is the most important thing"" effectively reinforces the key message. Maintains good flow between sentences.

Weaknesses: Slightly longer than the other complete translation, though still appropriate for B1 level. The phrase ""don't even know you're thinking about"" could potentially be simplified further.

The wild dogs in Moscow are a fascinating example of animals living in a city. There are about 35,000 wild dogs living in the streets of Moscow. Some were born in the wild, but others used to be pets that people left behind. 

These dogs live in different ways – some are alone, and others live in groups called packs. In 2010, scientists studied these dogs and discovered they have adapted very well to city life. They’ve learned how to survive in an urban environment. For example, they’ve found it’s safer to cross the road with people, and some even seem to know what traffic lights mean.

(Traffic lights are the coloured lights that control traffic – red means stop, green means go.)","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains clear, simple sentence structure appropriate for B1 level. Uses accessible vocabulary like ""groups"" instead of ""packs."" Preserves all key information from the original text accurately.

Weaknesses: Uses ""fascinating"" which may be challenging for B1 learners. Does not provide any vocabulary support or explanations for potentially difficult concepts.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes helpful vocabulary definitions at the end for ""adapt"" and ""urban."" Maintains good sentence structure and flow. Adds clarifying phrase ""how to survive in an urban environment"" which reinforces comprehension.

Weaknesses: Retains the word ""packs"" without explanation, though it does clarify with ""groups called packs."" The vocabulary definitions are placed at the end rather than integrated contextually.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides contextual explanation of traffic lights in parentheses, which directly supports comprehension. Uses clear, simple language throughout. Explains ""packs"" as ""groups called packs"" within the text.

Weaknesses: The traffic light explanation, while helpful, adds information not present in the original text. Uses ""fascinating"" without simplification.

**Comparison:**
All three models successfully simplify the language while maintaining the core meaning. Model 1 provides the most faithful translation but offers no learning support. Model 2 adds vocabulary support but separates it from context. Model 3 integrates explanations naturally but adds extra information about traffic lights that wasn't in the original.

For B1 learners, contextual support is more effective than separate definitions, and Model 3's approach of explaining concepts within the text flow is most pedagogically sound.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level. Successfully simplifies ""facial deformities"" to ""looked different"" and ""bestseller"" to ""very popular."" Maintains the personal tone with ""including me.""

Weaknesses: Loses some specificity by omitting that RJ Palacio is a ""New Yorker"" and changes ""New Yorker"" to ""American writer,"" which alters the original meaning. The phrase ""difficult topics"" adds interpretation not present in the original.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Preserves the ""New York"" reference from the original. Provides helpful definition of bullying in parentheses, which aids B1 comprehension. Uses clear, accessible vocabulary while maintaining most original details. Adds enthusiasm with exclamation mark.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""how her face was formed"" is somewhat awkward phrasing. The bullying definition, while helpful, adds content not in the original text. The exclamation mark changes the tone slightly from the original.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains clear B1-appropriate language. Preserves the New York reference. Uses ""different appearance"" which is a natural simplification of ""facial deformities."" Keeps the structure close to the original without major additions.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear vocabulary appropriate for B1 level. Maintains the core narrative structure and key information. The sentence ""she didn't like rats either"" preserves the original meaning well.

Weaknesses: Loses some nuance from the original, particularly the phrase ""lost count of the times she's patiently tried to explain"" becomes simply ""often explained,"" removing the sense of repetition and patience. The phrase ""fantastic pets"" is simplified to just ""good pets,"" reducing emphasis.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes helpful clarifying phrases like ""as pets"" at the end, which aids comprehension. Uses ""common pets"" instead of ""usual pets,"" which may be clearer. Maintains good flow with transitional words like ""though.""

Weaknesses: The sentence structure becomes somewhat awkward with ""She didn't like rats herself before her friend Martin showed her his"" - the pronoun reference could be confusing. Adds unnecessary words that weren't in the original.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Preserves more of the original's meaning while keeping B1-appropriate vocabulary. The phrase ""explained to many people"" better captures the repetitive nature than Model 1's ""often explained."" Uses ""though"" effectively for contrast. Maintains natural sentence flow.

Weaknesses: Still loses the specific detail about Chloe losing count and being patient in her explanations. The contraction ""aren't"" might be less formal than expected for some B1 contexts.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three models successfully simplify vocabulary and sentence structure for B1 level while preserving the main story elements. Model 3 retains the most meaning from the original while maintaining appropriate simplicity. Model 2 adds some helpful clarification but creates minor comprehension issues. Model 1 is the most simplified but loses more original nuance.

Strengths: Includes the endangered species concept with helpful explanation (""which means there are not many left""). Maintains most key information while using B1-appropriate vocabulary like ""risky"" instead of ""dangerous.""
Weaknesses: Changes ""electrocuted"" to the vaguer ""had accidents with electrical wires,"" losing some precision. The text ends abruptly and could flow better.

Weaknesses: Slightly longer than other versions, though still within B1 comprehension range. Minor change from ""electrocuted"" to ""died after touching"" slightly reduces precision.

People living in Berlin, Germany were unhappy about shooting wild pigs, and thought it was too cruel. Hunters and people who love animals argued about it. Because of these protests, the city council decided to try a kinder way to control the pigs. Now, instead of shooting them, they are building fences and it’s against the law to give them food. It’s not certain if this will work, as the number of pigs is increasing because the winters are getting warmer.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and sentence structures appropriate for B1 level. Maintains the core message about the conflict and new approach.
Weaknesses: Omits the specific mention of ""hunters and animal lovers"" as the arguing parties. The phrase ""big arguments"" is less precise than the original's ""heated arguments."" Loses some detail about the nature of the problem.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Preserves most key information from the original text, including the specific mention of hunters and animal lovers. Explains the fence purpose more clearly by adding ""to keep the pigs in certain areas."" Uses appropriate B1-level vocabulary while maintaining accuracy.
Weaknesses: Slightly longer than necessary for B1 level. The phrase ""kinder way"" adds interpretation not present in the original.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains essential information while using B1-appropriate language. Preserves the mention of hunters and animal lovers. Keeps the text concise while covering all main points.
Weaknesses: The phrase ""kinder way"" adds interpretation. Could benefit from slightly more explanation of some concepts for B1 learners.

**Comparison:**
Model 1 simplifies effectively but loses important details. Model 2 provides the most complete information transfer while remaining accessible, though it's somewhat verbose. Model 3 strikes a good balance between completeness and simplicity but shares Model 2's interpretive addition.

All models successfully adapt the vocabulary and sentence complexity for B1 level. Model 2 provides the clearest explanation of the fence strategy, while Model 3 is the most concise while retaining key information.

","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses clear, simple language appropriate for B1 level. Maintains the core narrative structure and includes all key plot points. The vocabulary is accessible and sentence structures are straightforward.

Weaknesses: Changes ""seven boys and seven girls"" to ""fourteen young people,"" losing the specific detail about gender balance that was emphasized in the original. Uses ""defeated"" instead of ""killed,"" which slightly softens the action. The phrase ""modern version"" doesn't capture the ""futuristic"" aspect mentioned in the original.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful explanations for potentially difficult concepts (defines ""myths"" as ""traditional stories from ancient Greece"" and ""labyrinth"" as ""complicated maze""). Maintains the specific detail of ""seven young men and seven young women."" Includes the king's name (Minos) and adds ""bravely"" to describe Theseus's actions. Uses formatting with italics for book titles.

Weaknesses: Slightly longer and more complex due to the explanatory additions, which may push beyond B1 level in some sentences. The added explanations, while helpful, make the text less concise.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains clear B1-level language while preserving most key details. Keeps the specific numbers ""seven young men and seven young women."" Includes the king's name (Minos) and provides a logical flow with ""As a result"" as a transition phrase.

Weaknesses: Changes ""punishment"" to ""As a result,"" which slightly alters the causal relationship. Like Model 1, uses ""modern version"" instead of capturing the ""futuristic"" element from the original.

All three models successfully simplify the language for B1 level while maintaining the essential story elements. Model 2 provides the most comprehensive information with helpful definitions, Model 3 offers good clarity with proper details, and Model 1 provides the simplest version but loses some specificity.

Campbell says that heroes usually don’t want to start their adventure at first. But then, someone older and wiser – a mentor – helps them and encourages them to begin. This is when the hero enters a new and different world where the adventure takes place.

",gemma-3-27b-it,"

Some people believe that writing down your dreams can help you have lucid dreams. These are dreams where you know you are dreaming, and you can even control what happens! For example, you could change a scary dream into a happy one, or decide what will happen next, like a director of a movie. Instead of just trying to understand your dreams, you can create them yourself. But it’s still good to have some normal dreams too – they can tell you what you’re thinking about!



","Some people believe that writing down your dreams can help you have more control over them. This control is called “lucid dreaming”. It means you know you are dreaming while it’s happening, and you can even change things in your dream. 

For example, if you’re having a bad dream, you might be able to make it better. Or, you could decide what happens next in your dream, just like a director controls a movie. 

Instead of only trying to understand what your dreams mean, you can start to create them yourself! But it’s still good to have some normal dreams too – they can show you what you’re thinking and feeling without you even realising it.

Some people believe that writing down your dreams can help you have lucid dreams. Lucid dreams happen when you know you are dreaming while you’re in the dream, and you can even change what happens.

Instead of just trying to understand what your dreams mean, you can actually create them yourself! But you might still want to have some normal dreams too, so your hidden thoughts and feelings can come out.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple, accessible language appropriate for B1 level. Successfully conveys the main concepts of lucid dreaming and dream control. The exclamation marks add engagement suitable for the target level.

Weaknesses: Loses some nuance from the original text. The phrase ""what you're thinking about"" oversimplifies the concept of subconscious communication. The translation is somewhat shorter and omits the specific mention of ""lucid dreaming"" as a term after the first sentence.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides clear structure with good paragraph breaks. Explains the term ""lucid dreaming"" explicitly, which aids comprehension. Maintains most of the original meaning while using B1-appropriate vocabulary. The final sentence effectively captures the subconscious aspect.

Weaknesses: Slightly more complex sentence structures in some parts. The phrase ""without you even realising it"" adds interpretation not present in the original.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains the term ""lucid dreams"" from the original while explaining it clearly. Maintains good balance between simplification and preserving original meaning. Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary throughout. The phrase ""hidden thoughts and feelings"" effectively conveys the subconscious concept.

Weaknesses: The sentence structure in some parts approaches the complexity of the original, which may challenge B1 readers. Minor awkwardness in ""while you're in the dream.""

**Ranking Assessment:**
Model 2 provides the clearest structure and most comprehensive explanation while maintaining B1 appropriateness. Model 3 preserves more of the original content and terminology effectively. Model 1, while accessible, sacrifices too much detail and nuance from the source text.

'Fast fashion' goes out of fashion as quickly as it came in and is often too poor quality to recycle; people don't want to buy it second-hand. Huge quantities end up being thrown away, and a lot of clothes that charities can't sell are sent abroad, causing even more economic and environmental problems.",gemma-3-27b-it,"Many people don’t know they contribute to clothing waste, even when they give clothes to charity. Charity shops receive a lot of clothes, but they can’t sell everything. ‘Fast fashion’ quickly becomes old-fashioned and is often too badly made to reuse. This means a lot of clothes are thrown away. Some unwanted clothes are sent to other countries, but this can cause problems for their economies and environment too.



","
Many people think they are helping the environment by giving old clothes to charity shops. However, charity shops receive so many clothes that they can’t sell them all. ‘Fast fashion’ – clothes that are made quickly and cheaply to follow the latest trends – quickly becomes unwanted. Often, this clothing isn’t good quality, so it can’t be recycled or sold second-hand. 

A lot of these clothes are thrown away. Some unwanted clothes are sent to other countries, but this can cause problems for their economies and the environment too. So, even donating clothes doesn’t always solve the problem of clothing waste.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level. Maintains the core message about clothing waste and charity shop limitations. The sentence structure is straightforward and accessible.

Weaknesses: Omits the key point that people might not realize they're part of the problem specifically because they donate to charity. Doesn't explain what ""fast fashion"" means, which could confuse B1 learners. The connection between donation and problem awareness is lost.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides a clear definition of ""fast fashion"" which helps B1 comprehension. Includes an explicit conclusion that reinforces the main message. Uses appropriate vocabulary level and sentence length for the target audience.

Weaknesses: Changes the opening focus from people not realizing their contribution to thinking they're helping the environment, which alters the original meaning. The text becomes longer than necessary for B1 level, potentially overwhelming learners.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Preserves the original meaning most accurately, including the key point about people not realizing they cause problems when donating. Provides a brief but helpful explanation of fast fashion. Maintains logical flow and includes all major points from the original.

Weaknesses: Could benefit from slightly simpler sentence structures in some places. The phrase ""causing a problem with clothes"" is somewhat awkward compared to ""contribute to clothing waste.""

- Includes the specific temperature measurement
- Provides helpful definitions in parentheses for B1 learners
- Maintains most key details from the original
- Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary and sentence structures

Weaknesses:
- The glacier definition is technically incorrect (describes it as moving ice rather than a crevasse)
- Slightly longer sentences may challenge some B1 readers
- Uses exclamation marks that weren't in the original tone

**Model 3 Analysis:**

Strengths:

It would spoil the story to tell you how it ends, so you’ll have to read the book to find out what happens to Pi and Richard Parker when they reach land.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level. Maintains the essential plot points and preserves the mystery of the ending. The sentence structure is straightforward and accessible.

Weaknesses: Oversimplifies some concepts - ""his religion"" instead of ""his three religions"" loses important detail. The phrase ""things change"" is vague compared to the original's more specific meaning. Some nuance is lost in the simplification.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains good detail while using B1-appropriate vocabulary. Preserves the reference to ""religious beliefs"" and includes specific mention of Mexico. The structure flows well and keeps reader engagement with the teaser ending.

Weaknesses: Uses ""extremely tired"" which might be slightly above B1 level. The phrase ""strong, dangerous storms"" adds an adjective not in the original. Slightly longer sentences may challenge some B1 readers.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Balances simplification with detail retention effectively. Uses clear B1 vocabulary and maintains the story's emotional elements. Preserves the author's intent about not spoiling the ending with similar phrasing.

Weaknesses: ""Things start to get better"" changes the original meaning - the original suggests change, not necessarily improvement. ""It would spoil the story"" is slightly more complex phrasing than necessary for B1 level.

**Overall Assessment:**
Model 1 achieves the clearest B1 simplification but sacrifices some important details. Model 2 retains more original content and flows naturally while staying mostly within B1 parameters. Model 3 provides a good balance but introduces a meaning change that affects accuracy.

Strengths:
- Uses simple, clear sentence structures appropriate for B1 level
- Maintains the core narrative flow
- Simplifies complex phrases effectively (e.g., ""filled up with evening sounds"" becomes ""became noisy"")

Weaknesses:
- Loses some specificity by changing ""cup of coffee"" to just ""coffee""
- Omits the detail about dad's ""beloved"" jazz, reducing emotional nuance
- ""She wanted to relax first"" changes the original meaning from wanting to enjoy quiet time to simply relaxing

**Model 2 Analysis:**

Strengths:
- Preserves the temporal aspect with ""decided to do it later""
- Uses ""peaceful time"" which better captures the original's ""quiet hour""
- Adds clarifying structure with ""Usually, when her parents were home"" to help B1 readers understand the contrast
- Maintains most key details from the original

Weaknesses:
- Changes ""cup of coffee"" to just ""coffee""
- Alters ""while he cooked dinner"" to ""while he made dinner,"" though this is minor
- Uses a dash for emphasis which may be slightly advanced for B1

**Model 3 Analysis:**

Strengths:
- Retains ""cup of coffee"" from the original text
- Preserves ""decided to do it later"" showing clear temporal planning
- Uses ""peaceful time"" effectively

NASA thinks there are about 50 more NEOs to find, but they say that none of the 887 they already know about are a big threat to Earth.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains accurate information and uses appropriate B1-level vocabulary. The sentence structure is clear and accessible. Successfully preserves the key numerical data (90%, 1km, 50 million km, 50 remaining, 887 total).

Weaknesses: The phrase ""almost like mountains"" slightly changes the meaning from the original's direct comparison. The translation is somewhat condensed, potentially losing some clarity about what constitutes a NEO.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful context by explaining NASA as ""the US space agency."" Uses engaging formatting with an exclamation mark to emphasize size. Clearly explains Earth's orbital path. Good paragraph structure that breaks down complex information.

Weaknesses: Adds interpretive language not present in the original (""likely to hit Earth and cause serious damage"" vs. ""significant danger""). The exclamation mark, while engaging, may not match the original's neutral tone.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses accessible language like ""space rocks"" and ""team that watches for space rocks"" which is very B1-appropriate. Maintains technical accuracy while simplifying complex concepts. Provides clear explanation of NEO definition.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""team that watches for space rocks"" oversimplifies ""planetary defence team,"" potentially losing some precision. Uses ""big threat"" instead of ""significant danger,"" which is less formal.

All three models successfully adapt the content for B1 level by simplifying vocabulary and sentence structure while maintaining factual accuracy. Model 2 provides the most comprehensive explanation with helpful context, though it adds some interpretation. Model 1 offers the most faithful translation with good simplification. Model 3 uses the most accessible language but sacrifices some precision.

Strengths: Provides helpful explanation of ""civil engineering"" which aids B1 comprehension. Uses accessible language like ""breaks or falls down"" instead of just ""collapse."" Adds context about safety importance.

Weaknesses: Omits the global scale reference from the original. The phrase ""cross over things like"" is somewhat informal. The explanation becomes lengthy, potentially overwhelming for B1 readers.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains the global context (""biggest and most costly transportation projects in the world""). Provides clear explanation of ""civil engineering."" Uses ""deep valleys"" to clarify ""mountain gorges."" Maintains logical flow and includes safety emphasis.

Weaknesses: Slightly longer sentences that approach B2 complexity. Could be marginally challenging for lower B1 learners.

**Ranking Analysis:**
Model 3 preserves the most original meaning while remaining accessible. Model 2 provides good explanations but loses important context. Model 1 is the most simplified but sacrifices too much original content and creates potential confusion about inspection timing.

**(Note: ""satisfactorily"" has been simplified to ""well"". ""Vague"" is kept as it's a useful word at B1, but the explanation clarifies its meaning through context.)**","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple sentence structures and basic vocabulary appropriate for B1 level. Maintains the core meaning of the original text. The phrase ""wasn't helping enough"" effectively simplifies the original concept.

Weaknesses: Loses some nuance by changing ""After weeks of frustration"" to ""was frustrated with her team for several weeks,"" which shifts the focus from general frustration to team-specific frustration. The phrase ""wasn't being clear"" is somewhat less precise than the original ""vague.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Adds helpful clarification with ""She was disappointed he didn't offer more help,"" which makes the manager's inadequate response clearer for B1 readers. Uses ""colleagues"" as an appropriate synonym for ""team members."" Maintains good sentence flow and readability.

Weaknesses: Changes ""Swedish manager"" to ""manager in Sweden,"" which slightly alters the meaning - the original suggests the manager's nationality, not just location. The addition of extra explanation, while helpful, makes the text longer than necessary.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Preserves the temporal aspect with ""frustrated for several weeks."" Uses ""doing a good job"" which is clear B1 vocabulary. Maintains the structure closest to the original while simplifying language appropriately.

Weaknesses: The editorial note about keeping ""vague"" is contradictory since ""vague"" doesn't actually appear in this translation. Uses ""wasn't being clear enough"" similar to Model 1, which is less precise than the original concept.

**(Note: ‘emigrate’ means to leave one country to live in another. A ‘lifeboat’ is a small boat used to save people from a sinking ship.)**","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simpler vocabulary consistently (""chosen"" instead of ""elected,"" ""boat"" instead of ""ship,"" ""die"" instead of ""drown""). The sentence structure is straightforward and accessible for B1 learners.

Weaknesses: Changes ""North America"" to just ""America,"" which alters the geographical accuracy. Uses ""safe in a small boat"" which contradicts the dangerous situation Pi faces. Does not provide explanatory notes for potentially difficult terms.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains geographical accuracy with ""North America."" Adds helpful clarification ""with the animals as passengers too"" and ""into the sea."" Includes a useful explanatory note about orang-utan. Uses ""survives"" which clearly explains Pi's situation.

Weaknesses: Slightly more complex sentence structure in some parts. The explanatory note format with asterisk may be less clear than other formatting options.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Preserves the original meaning most accurately. Maintains ""North America"" and uses appropriate B1-level vocabulary substitutions. Provides comprehensive explanatory notes for both ""emigrate/lifeboat"" and ""orang-utan"" concepts using clear formatting.

Weaknesses: Retains ""ship"" instead of simplifying to ""boat,"" though this is still within B1 vocabulary range. The explanatory notes, while helpful, add length to the text.

**Overall Assessment:**
Model 3 maintains the highest fidelity to the original while providing necessary support for B1 learners. Model 2 offers good simplification with helpful context. Model 1 provides the simplest language but sacrifices some accuracy and context.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for B1 level (""sorts out,"" ""hidden meaning,"" ""quieter""). The sentence structure is clear and accessible. Successfully maintains the core meaning of the original text.

Weaknesses: Completely omits the concept of ""symbolic meaning,"" which is a key element in the original text. The phrase ""hidden meaning"" doesn't fully capture the symbolic nature of dreams described in the source.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes all key concepts from the original, including symbolic meaning. Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary (""tidies up,"" ""less busy""). Provides a helpful explanation of symbolic meaning with a concrete example. The footnote effectively supports B1 learners' comprehension.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for B1 level. Successfully simplifies ""self-disclosure"" by removing the term entirely and explaining the concept in plain language. Maintains the core message about the importance of deep connections.

Weaknesses: Loses some nuance from the original text, particularly the distinction between ""at least one person"" and ""a network of other relationships."" The phrase ""sharing what you really think and feel"" slightly changes the meaning from discussing personal feelings to expressing opinions.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains the term ""self-disclosure"" while providing a clear explanation, which helps vocabulary building. Maintains good paragraph structure and preserves the distinction between deep connections and broader social networks. Uses appropriate B1-level grammar and vocabulary.

Weaknesses: Slightly longer sentences in some places may challenge B1 readers. The phrase ""what's really on your mind"" is somewhat informal and may not precisely convey the concept of personal feelings.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses clear, accessible language throughout. Provides a good explanation of self-disclosure without using the technical term. Maintains the logical flow and key points from the original text.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""sharing your thoughts and feelings"" in quotes appears awkward and unnecessary. The explanation conflates thoughts with feelings, which slightly alters the original meaning that focused specifically on personal feelings.

All three models successfully adapt the text to B1 level by using simpler vocabulary and shorter sentences. They maintain the main arguments about relationship quality over quantity and the importance of listening skills.

Gary Collins was a policeman on holiday when he saw news about the riots in London on television. He recognised some people he knew in the news reports. He stopped his holiday early and went to help the police identify people involved.

He spent six months looking at videos from security cameras (CCTV). He recognised 190 people, and often he could identify them just by looking at their faces. His work was very important to the investigation. 

Even though police used computer programs to recognise faces, these programs only found one person. They looked at a very large amount of video – 200,000 hours in total – but couldn’t help as much as Gary Collins.

Strengths:
- Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level
- Maintains the key facts and numbers accurately
- Good sentence structure that flows naturally
- Effectively contrasts human vs. computer identification capabilities

Weaknesses:
- Changes ""eyes alone"" to ""faces,"" losing the specific detail about identifying people from just their eyes
- Slightly less detailed than the original regarding the facial recognition software context

**Model 2 Analysis:**

Strengths:
- Provides helpful explanations (defines CCTV as ""security cameras"")
- Uses very accessible vocabulary
- Adds clarifying context in the final sentence about the computer programs' limited effectiveness
- Maintains all key numerical information

Weaknesses:
- Changes ""eyes alone"" to ""faces,"" missing the specific detail
- Slightly wordy in places, which may not be necessary for B1 level
- The phrase ""news about the riots"" adds interpretation not present in the original

**Model 3 Analysis:**

Strengths:
- Preserves the original structure most closely
- Uses appropriate B1-level vocabulary while maintaining precision
- Includes helpful clarification (CCTV as ""security cameras"")
- Keeps the contrast between human and computer identification clear

Weaknesses:
- Also changes ""eyes alone"" to ""faces,"" losing the specific detail about eye identification
- Could be slightly more simplified for B1 level in some phrases

All three translations miss the specific detail that Gary Collins identified people ""from their eyes alone,"" which was a notable aspect of his skill. All three maintain the essential story structure and key information. Model 2 provides the most explanatory context, while Model 3 stays closest to the original structure. Model 1 is the most concise while remaining clear.

**(Augmenting means improving something by adding to it. Implant means to put something inside the body.)**



","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level. Successfully conveys the main ideas about technology integration and human enhancement. The sentence structure is straightforward and accessible.

Weaknesses: Loses the concept of ""evolution as a species"" entirely, replacing it with the vaguer ""improve as humans."" The phrase ""audiovisual perception"" is simplified to just ""seeing and hearing,"" which loses some meaning. Does not provide any vocabulary support for potentially challenging terms.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the concept of change and improvement over time with ""help our bodies change and improve faster."" Provides a helpful definition for ""augmenting our bodies"" in parentheses. Uses appropriate B1-level vocabulary while preserving more of the original meaning.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""help our bodies change and improve faster"" is somewhat awkward and doesn't clearly convey the evolutionary concept. The explanation is brief and could be more comprehensive for B1 learners.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Best preserves the original meaning with ""develop faster as humans,"" which maintains the evolutionary concept. Provides clear, comprehensive explanations for two key terms (augmenting and implant) in a well-formatted way. Uses natural, flowing language that remains accessible to B1 learners.

Weaknesses: The vocabulary explanations, while helpful, are quite basic and could potentially be more detailed for complex concepts like human augmentation.

**Ranking Analysis:**
Model 3 maintains the most accurate meaning while providing the best learning support. Model 2 offers good vocabulary support but with less natural phrasing. Model 1, while clear, loses significant meaning from the original text and provides no learning assistance.

","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Simplifies complex vocabulary effectively (e.g., ""hit the nail on the head"" becomes ""made some good points""). Uses clear, accessible language appropriate for B1 level. Maintains the core message about parental influence and teenage behavior.

Weaknesses: Changes ""waiting at a red light"" to ""driving,"" which alters the meaning and creates a safety concern implication not present in the original. Loses some specificity in the translation of idiomatic expressions.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Accurately translates ""waiting at a red light"" as ""waiting for a traffic light,"" preserving the original meaning. Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary while maintaining clarity. Includes the phrase ""said something important,"" which adds emphasis similar to the original's ""valid point.""

Weaknesses: Slightly wordier than necessary in some places. The phrase ""make plans to meet up"" adds words not essential to the core meaning.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Preserves the rhetorical question structure from the original (""How can we ask...""), maintaining the speaker's argumentative tone. Accurately translates the traffic light reference. Uses concise, clear language appropriate for B1 level.

Weaknesses: Changes ""cooking the evening meal"" to ""making dinner,"" which is acceptable but less specific. Minor loss of detail in ""when they're driving"" instead of specifying the traffic light context.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three models successfully adapt the text to B1 level by simplifying vocabulary and sentence structures. Model 2 provides the most accurate content translation, while Model 3 best preserves the original's rhetorical structure. Model 1 contains a meaning-altering error regarding the driving context.

However, terrorism has shot up in the last few years and, since World War II, wars have killed many more civilians than soldiers. Even for civilians, though, the statistics are not all bad.

Now, her work is starting to have an effect – people in Bangladesh, and around the world, are beginning to notice and listen.



","**Model 1 Analysis:**

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and sentence structures appropriate for B1 level. Maintains the core message about combining mountaineering with human rights advocacy. The phrase ""doing the trick"" is appropriately simplified to ""getting attention.""

Weaknesses: Loses the specific detail about Bangladesh being coastal. The phrase ""left with nothing"" is simplified to ""left the women with no support,"" which changes the meaning slightly. The translation is somewhat choppy with abrupt transitions between ideas.

**Model 2 Analysis:**

Strengths: Adds helpful clarification with ""when the money ran out"" to explain why projects stopped. Maintains the coastal reference and includes an exclamation mark to convey enthusiasm about the mountain observation. Uses clear, accessible language throughout. Good flow between paragraphs.

Weaknesses: Changes ""left with nothing"" to a more explanatory phrase, which may oversimplify the original meaning. The phrase ""become stronger"" is an interpretation rather than a direct translation of ""stand up for itself.""

Strengths: Preserves the coastal geography reference accurately. Uses appropriate B1-level vocabulary while maintaining precision. The phrase ""without leaving any lasting help"" effectively captures the original meaning. Good sentence structure and logical flow.

Weaknesses: The ending phrase ""beginning to notice and listen"" adds ""listen"" which wasn't in the original text. Some sentences could be slightly more dynamic in their construction.

**Overall Comparison:**

All three models successfully adapt the text to B1 level by using simpler vocabulary and shorter sentences. Model 2 provides the most context and explanation, making it most accessible to B1 learners. Model 3 maintains the highest fidelity to the original meaning while still being accessible.

Strengths: Maintains the core narrative structure and emotional progression. Uses appropriate B1-level vocabulary and sentence structures. Successfully conveys the concept of the feedback sandwich with a clear explanation.

Weaknesses: Omits the detail about the manager ""stopping"" the employee, which changes the initial dynamic. The phrase ""say what they really want to say"" is replaced with ""real feedback,"" which loses some of the original meaning about underlying criticism.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Preserves the weekend worry period and Monday morning timeline. Includes a separate explanatory paragraph that clearly defines the feedback sandwich concept. Uses accessible vocabulary appropriate for B1 level.

Weaknesses: Loses the detail about being ""stopped"" by the manager. The phrase ""just to be polite"" doesn't fully capture the original meaning of ""obligatory praise."" The separation of the explanation into a new paragraph changes the text structure significantly.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the narrative flow while integrating the explanation naturally within the same paragraph. Preserves the key emotional elements and timeline. Uses simple, clear language suitable for B1 level.

Weaknesses: Also omits the ""stopping"" detail from the opening. The explanation is somewhat compressed, though still comprehensible. The phrase ""just to be polite"" similarly doesn't fully capture the ""obligatory"" aspect.

**Ranking Assessment:**
Model 3 maintains the best balance between simplification and preservation of the original meaning. It integrates the explanation smoothly without disrupting the narrative flow. Model 1 provides a solid translation but loses some nuance in the feedback sandwich explanation. Model 2, while clear, significantly alters the text structure with its separate explanatory paragraph.

Born in the USA is a lively rock album with songs that make you want to move. However, the lyrics are also quite emotional. Although the music is upbeat, the songs tell stories about difficult times and the disappointments people face when trying to achieve their dreams.

For example, “Glory Days” is about people remembering their youth, and “Downbound Train” is about a young man whose life goes wrong after he loses his job. You can feel that the artist was inspired by people he knew and thought about his own life. This album shows just how talented Bruce Springsteen – “The Boss” – really is.

- Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary (""scary film idea,"" ""having fun,"" ""brave and clever"")
- Maintains the core narrative structure
- Simplifies complex phrases effectively (""late 1900s"" for ""late 20th century"")

Weaknesses:
- Loses the concept identification (""cliché"" becomes generic ""idea"")
- Omits the transformation detail about becoming ""the toughest and most resourceful person in the world""
- Final sentence changes meaning from ""wins"" to merely ""survives""
- Less precise in conveying the complete character arc

**Model 2 Analysis:**

Strengths:
- Preserves all key narrative elements
- Maintains logical flow and structure
- Introduces the technical term ""final girl"" which adds valuable context
- Includes the victory aspect (""defeats the killer"")
- Uses clear B1-appropriate language throughout

Weaknesses:
- Slightly longer than necessary for B1 level
- The addition of ""final girl"" terminology, while helpful, wasn't in the original text

**Model 3 Analysis:**

Strengths:
- Concise and well-structured
- Maintains all essential plot elements
- Uses quotation marks around ""last girl"" to indicate it's a specific term
- Clear progression from weak to strong character
- Appropriate vocabulary level

Weaknesses:
- Opens with ""common idea"" which is less specific than ""cliché""
- Doesn't mention the winning/victory aspect as clearly as the original
- Slightly less detailed about the character transformation

All three translations successfully adapt the text to B1 level, but they vary in completeness and accuracy. Model 2 provides the most comprehensive adaptation while maintaining clarity. Model 3 offers good conciseness but loses some specificity. Model 1, while clear, omits several important details from the original.

115-b1,"If we want to know where our capability for complex language came from, we need to look at how our brains are different from other animals. This relates to more than just brain size; it is important what other things our brains can do and when and why they evolved that way. And for this there are very few physical clues; artefacts left by our ancestors don't tell us what speech they were capable of making. One thing we can see in the remains of early humans, however, is the development of the mouth, throat and tongue. By about 100,000 years ago, humans had evolved the ability to create complex sounds.

**(Note: ‘evolutionary biologists’ are scientists who study how living things have changed over time. ‘ancestors’ are people who lived before us.)**



","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains clear sentence structure and uses appropriate B1 vocabulary. Successfully preserves the main ideas while simplifying complex concepts. The phrase ""make educated guesses"" is well-chosen for B1 level.

Weaknesses: Omits the temporal aspect (""when"") from the original discussion about brain evolution. The phrase ""objects from our ancestors"" is slightly awkward compared to alternatives.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes all key temporal elements (""when"" and ""why"") from the original. Provides helpful explanation of evolution as a concept. Uses clear paragraph breaks that improve readability. The phrase ""scientists who study evolution (called evolutionary biologists)"" effectively explains technical terminology.

Weaknesses: Slightly longer than necessary for B1 level, which may impact comprehension. Some sentences could be more concise.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains good flow and readability. Includes explanatory notes at the end to define technical terms, which supports B1 learners. Preserves the uncertainty aspect with ""whether they used simple sounds or not.""

Weaknesses: The explanatory notes, while helpful, break the text flow and may not be the most integrated approach for B1 adaptation. Omits the ""when"" element from the brain evolution discussion.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three models successfully adapt the text to B1 level by simplifying vocabulary and sentence structures while maintaining factual accuracy. Model 2 provides the most complete information transfer, including all temporal aspects. Model 1 offers the most streamlined approach. Model 3 attempts to support learners with definitions but does so in a way that interrupts the text flow.

116-b1,"It is society, not nature, that tells us girls should favour arts and humanities and leave maths and physics to the boys. Coupled with this is the lack of positive female role models youngsters see doing science-related jobs. Cartoons and stories often show the crazy scientist, genius inventor, or adventurous astronaut as a man. Furthermore, there is an unfortunate perception that scientists are geeky, have poor social skills or that their work is lonely and detached from the rest of the world. These are false stereotypes portrayed by the media, but they may mean that girls do not identify with scientists, and see science as an unappealing career path. If girls saw more positive female role models in science it would give them more confidence and a greater sense of belonging in those subjects.",gemma-3-27b-it,"
Society, not nature, often encourages girls to study subjects like art and languages, and boys to study maths and science. There aren’t many famous female scientists that young people see, and stories often show scientists as men. Also, people sometimes think scientists are strange or don’t have many friends, which isn’t true. These ideas in the media can make science seem less interesting to girls, and make them feel they don’t belong. If girls had more female scientists to look up to, they might feel more confident and want to study these subjects.



","

It’s not natural for girls to prefer subjects like art and literature – society teaches them to. We are often told that boys are better at subjects like maths and physics. Also, young people don’t often see women working in science jobs. 

Often, in cartoons and stories, scientists, inventors, and astronauts are shown as men. There’s also a wrong idea that scientists are strange, not very social, or work alone. These ideas come from TV, films and other media. 

Because of these ideas, girls might not think science is a job for them, and they might not want to study it. If girls had more examples of successful women in science, they would feel more confident and like they belong in these subjects. This would encourage more girls to choose science as a career.



**Note:** *Stereotypes* are oversimplified and often untrue ideas about groups of people. In this text, they refer to false beliefs about scientists. *Role models* are people we admire and look up to.","

","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and sentence structures appropriate for B1 level. The message is clear and accessible.
Weaknesses: Significantly shortens the original content, omitting key details like specific examples (cartoons, stories showing scientists as men) and the detailed explanation of stereotypes. The phrase ""don't have many friends"" oversimplifies ""poor social skills."" Lacks the nuanced argument structure of the original.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains most of the original content and arguments. Includes helpful definitions of key terms (stereotypes, role models) which aids B1 comprehension. Preserves the logical flow and examples from the original text. Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary while keeping the meaning intact.
Weaknesses: Some sentences could be shorter for B1 level. The structure remains somewhat complex in places.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses clear, simple language appropriate for B1 level. Maintains the main arguments and includes specific examples. Good use of transition phrases like ""What's more"" and ""For example.""
Weaknesses: Omits the final sentence about giving girls confidence and belonging, which weakens the conclusion. The opening phrase ""It's not natural, but society"" creates a slightly awkward construction. Missing some content compared to the original.

**Ranking Analysis:**
Model 2 provides the most complete translation while maintaining B1 accessibility, includes helpful definitions, and preserves the argument structure. Model 3 offers good simplification but loses important content. Model 1, while simple, sacrifices too much original meaning and detail.
