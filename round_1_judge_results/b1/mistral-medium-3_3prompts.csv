But to really understand what they mean for you, think about what is happening in your life and how you feel every day.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains clear structure and uses appropriate B1 vocabulary. Successfully simplifies ""insights"" to ""ideas"" and ""having no clothes on"" to ""being naked."" The sentence flow is natural and easy to follow.

Weaknesses: Loses some nuance by changing ""insights into things"" to just ""ideas about things."" The phrase ""think about how they connect"" is slightly less direct than the original's emphasis on making connections.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses ""reveal"" which is appropriate for B1 level and maintains the meaning well. Good simplification of complex concepts. The structure flows logically and uses ""emotions"" instead of ""feelings"" for variety.

Weaknesses: Adds ""thoughts and feelings you didn't know you had"" which slightly changes the original meaning. The repetition of ""similar"" in consecutive sentences creates awkward phrasing.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very accessible vocabulary throughout. The final sentence effectively breaks down the complex original ending into simpler components. Maintains the core message clearly.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""show you things you didn't know you were thinking about"" is somewhat awkward. The ending ""what is happening in your life and how you feel every day"" is wordier than necessary and changes the emphasis from connecting dreams to daily events.

**Ranking Analysis:**
Model 1 provides the most faithful translation while maintaining appropriate B1 simplification. Model 2 has good vocabulary choices but contains meaning shifts and repetitive phrasing. Model 3 uses very accessible language but has awkward constructions and verbose endings.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level. Maintains all key information from the original text. The sentence structure is straightforward and accessible.

Weaknesses: Changes ""cases"" to maintain the same word, creating a minor grammatical inconsistency with ""is"" instead of ""are."" The phrase ""people left behind"" is less precise than ""abandoned by their owners.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Changes ""cases"" to ""examples"" which improves clarity and flow. Maintains grammatical consistency throughout. Adds ""For example"" which enhances text cohesion and makes the connection between ideas clearer. Preserves all original meaning while using B1-appropriate vocabulary.

Weaknesses: Slightly longer than necessary with the addition of ""of these dogs"" and ""For example,"" though this doesn't significantly impact B1 accessibility.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses ""examples"" instead of ""cases"" for better clarity. Maintains simple sentence structures suitable for B1 level. Preserves all essential information from the original text.

Weaknesses: Has the same grammatical issue as Model 1 with the singular/plural agreement (""examples...is""). The phrase ""people left behind"" is less specific than the original ""abandoned by their owners.""

All three models successfully simplify vocabulary and sentence structure for B1 level. Model 2 provides the best grammatical consistency and adds helpful transitional language.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for B1 level (""different-looking face,"" ""very popular,"" ""excited""). The sentence structure is clear and accessible.
Weaknesses: Changes ""New Yorker"" to ""from New York,"" which alters the meaning slightly. Omits the reference to Palacio's website explanation. Uses ""many awards"" instead of preserving the more specific ""several awards.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains appropriate B1 vocabulary while using ""facial differences,"" which is more respectful than the original ""deformities."" Preserves the meaning accurately. Sentence structure remains clear and accessible.
Weaknesses: Omits the reference to Palacio's website where she explained her inspiration. Changes ""several awards"" to ""many prizes.""

Last year, when one of Martin’s rats had babies, Chloe decided she wanted two of them.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level. Maintains the core narrative structure and key information. The sentence ""She didn't like them either until her friend Martin showed her his pet rats"" flows naturally.

Weaknesses: Loses some nuance from the original, particularly the phrase ""has lost count of the times she's patiently tried to explain"" which becomes simply ""often tells people."" The word ""patiently"" and the sense of repeated frustration are omitted. ""Take two of them"" is less precise than ""wanted two of them.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes ""named"" which clarifies the relationship between Chloe and her pets. Adds ""at first"" which helps clarify the temporal sequence of Chloe's changing attitude. Uses ""wanted"" which better captures Chloe's desire. The logical flow with ""because"" creates clear cause-and-effect relationships.

Weaknesses: The sentence structure ""She understands why some people don't like rats because she didn't like them either at first"" creates a long, potentially complex sentence for B1 level. Some original details about patient explanation are simplified.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes ""named"" for clarity. Uses ""In fact"" which adds emphasis and helps structure the argument about rats being good pets. Maintains the key narrative elements and emotional progression. ""Tried to tell"" partially preserves the effort aspect from the original.

Weaknesses: ""In fact"" might be slightly above B1 complexity level. The phrase ""take good care"" uses slightly different vocabulary than the other models. Like others, simplifies the ""lost count of times patiently"" concept.

**Overall Comparison:**
All three models successfully adapt the text to B1 level vocabulary and sentence structure. Model 2 provides the clearest logical connections and temporal markers. Model 3 adds useful emphasis but may be slightly more complex. Model 1 is the most straightforward but loses more original nuance.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for B1 level (""hurt"" instead of ""injured,"" ""wires"" instead of ""electric cables""). Maintains clear sentence structure and preserves all key information from the original text.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""worked a little"" is somewhat informal and imprecise compared to ""had some success."" The simplification of ""electrocuted"" to ""get electrocuted"" changes the tense consistency.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains good vocabulary level with ""in danger of disappearing"" as a clear explanation of ""endangered species."" Preserves the meaning accurately while using accessible language. Good use of ""take them to the countryside"" instead of ""release them.""

Weaknesses: Changes ""electrocuted"" to ""died from touching electric wires,"" which adds information not explicitly stated in the original (that they died rather than were just electrocuted). Uses ""worked a little"" which is less precise than the original meaning.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides the most complete adaptation by including ""because they remember it as a place where they can easily find food,"" which captures the original concept of baboons seeing the city ""as a source of easy food."" Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary throughout. Maintains accuracy while simplifying complex concepts.

Weaknesses: Like Model 2, changes ""electrocuted"" to ""died from touching electric wires,"" adding interpretive information. The phrase ""hurt or killed by cars"" is slightly less precise than ""car accidents.""

Strengths: Maintains all key information from the original text, uses appropriate B1-level vocabulary, and preserves the overall structure and meaning effectively.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""talking with coworkers"" loses some nuance from the original ""idle chit-chat,"" making the translation slightly less precise in conveying the casual nature of office conversations.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses clear B1-appropriate language and includes the phrase ""just to pass the time,"" which effectively captures the meaning of ""idle chit-chat"" from the original text.

Weaknesses: Omits the ""online"" aspect of the work, which is a factual detail present in the original. The structure breaks the text into two paragraphs where the original was one continuous paragraph.

Strengths: Provides the most complete information transfer, including details about ""poor neighborhoods"" and making walls ""more attractive."" Uses varied B1-appropriate vocabulary like ""eye-catching"" and ""unfairness."" Maintains good sentence flow and coherence.

Weaknesses: Slightly longer sentences that approach B2 complexity. The phrase ""important issues like"" adds emphasis not in the original.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very accessible B1 vocabulary and simple sentence structures. Breaks complex ideas into shorter, clearer sentences. Successfully simplifies ""became very big"" for ""explosion.""

Weaknesses: Loses some meaning precision - ""interesting work"" doesn't fully capture ""attractive work."" The sentence fragmentation, while simpler, creates a somewhat choppy reading experience. Omits the connection between the three concepts (color, life, beauty) that the original presents as a unified idea.

- Uses simple, clear vocabulary appropriate for B1 level
- Maintains the core message about advertising bombardment and disposable fashion
- Sentence structure is straightforward and accessible

Weaknesses:
- Loses the specific term ""disposable items"" which is important to the meaning
- Omits the precise detail ""two or three times"" from the original
- Slightly oversimplifies the connection between cheap prices and throwaway behavior

**Model 2 Analysis:**

Strengths:

Strengths: Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary with clear, simple sentence structures. The phrase ""safer his job was"" effectively conveys the meaning while remaining accessible. Successfully simplifies complex descriptions like the atlas comparison to ""shapes on a map.""

Weaknesses: Loses some atmospheric detail from the original, such as the specific action of squinting against the sun. The description of the car's movement is simplified to just ""drove up,"" missing the dust trail imagery.

Strengths: Maintains more descriptive language while staying at B1 level, using ""narrowed his eyes"" and ""dust cloud."" Preserves the restless movement of horses with ""moved restlessly."" Includes the clarifying phrase ""Otherwise"" which helps maintain the original's contrast.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""swatting flies"" might be slightly more advanced than typical B1 vocabulary. Some sentences are longer and more complex, potentially challenging for B1 readers.

Strengths: Uses very simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level. Maintains the essential plot points and character relationships. The sentence structure is consistently straightforward and accessible.

Weaknesses: Significantly reduces descriptive elements, losing atmospheric details like ""squinted against the sun"" (simplified to just ""looked at""). Omits the nuanced description of how the boss avoids the workplace. The translation feels somewhat mechanical and loses literary quality.

**Overall Assessment:**
Model 2 retains the most literary quality while remaining accessible, though it pushes the upper bounds of B1 complexity. Model 1 provides a good balance between simplification and meaning retention. Model 3 prioritizes simplicity but sacrifices too much descriptive content and atmosphere.

Strengths: Includes ""wild pigs"" which provides important context missing in Model 1. Uses ""city government"" instead of ""city council"" which may be more familiar to B1 learners. Explains the causal relationship in the final sentence more clearly with ""causing more pigs to survive.""
Weaknesses: ""Strong arguments"" is slightly less accessible than ""big arguments"" for B1 level. The sentence structure is somewhat more complex than necessary for the target level.

Strengths: Uses clear, simple language appropriate for B1 level. Maintains the core narrative structure and key details. The phrase ""modern version of Theseus"" effectively conveys the comparison.

Weaknesses: Omits the author's full name (Suzanne Collins) and the king's name (Minos). Changes ""futuristic"" to ""modern,"" which alters the specific meaning. Uses ""children"" instead of maintaining the age distinction of ""youths.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides complete author identification. Includes proper formatting with italicized titles. Maintains most key details including the mythological reference. Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary while preserving meaning.

Weaknesses: Changes ""eaten by"" to ""killed by,"" losing the specific brutality described in the original. Omits the king's name (Minos). Replaces ""futuristic"" with ""modern.""

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains the king's name (Minos), which other models omitted. Uses accessible language like ""old Greek stories"" for ""classical Greek mythology."" Maintains the ""eaten by"" detail. Provides clear character identification.

Weaknesses: Simplifies ""classical Greek mythology"" perhaps too much. Uses ""fought back"" instead of ""rebelled,"" which is less precise. The phrase ""really liked"" is somewhat informal for the context.

All three models successfully adapt the text to B1 level while preserving the essential narrative. Model 2 provides the most complete contextual information, Model 3 retains more specific details from the original, and Model 1 offers the most streamlined approach but loses some precision.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level. Maintains the core meaning while being concise.
Weaknesses: Loses some important details from the original, such as the concept of ""bringing people and animals together"" and the educational aspect of inspiring people. The phrase ""left as pets"" is unclear and doesn't convey abandonment properly.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains more detail from the original text while keeping language accessible. Successfully conveys the educational purpose and includes the concept of protecting habitats (""homes""). Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary and sentence structures.
Weaknesses: The phrase ""left by their owners"" could be clearer as ""abandoned by their owners."" Some nuance about the potential of zoos is simplified.

Strengths: Maintains the original question structure and key vocabulary like ""vandalism."" Uses appropriate B1-level simplifications such as ""how you see it"" for ""point of view"" and ""city leaders"" for ""city councils."" Preserves all main ideas accurately.

Weaknesses: Retains ""vandalism"" which may be challenging vocabulary for B1 learners. The phrase ""stopped by the police"" could be clearer.

Strengths: Maintains the original structure and flow well. Uses appropriate B1-level vocabulary while preserving key terms like ""mentor"" and ""Death Star."" The sentence structure is clear and accessible.
Weaknesses: Loses some specificity by omitting ""cross the threshold"" concept entirely. The phrase ""says no to the adventure"" is somewhat informal compared to the original tone.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful clarification by explaining ""mentor"" as ""wise guide."" Uses clear, simple sentence structures appropriate for B1 level. Adds formatting with italics for *Star Wars* and uses ""For example"" to make the connection clearer.
Weaknesses: Completely removes the attribution to Campbell, which changes the academic tone. The restructuring into separate paragraphs alters the original organization significantly.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains the Campbell attribution and maintains the academic structure. Uses accessible vocabulary while keeping the logical flow. The phrase ""leave their normal life"" adds helpful context for B1 learners.
Weaknesses: Changes ""mentor"" to ""teacher,"" which alters the specific literary terminology. Uses ""difficult tasks"" instead of ""tests,"" which loses some precision of the original concept.

**Overall Comparison:**
Model 1 stays closest to the original structure while simplifying appropriately. Model 2 makes the text more accessible but significantly changes the format and removes important attribution. Model 3 maintains good structure but makes unnecessary terminology changes that reduce accuracy.

Strengths: Maintains clear structure and uses appropriate B1-level vocabulary. The translation is concise and preserves the main concepts effectively. The sentence flow is natural and easy to follow.

Weaknesses: Omits the concept of ""peer-to-peer sharing activities"" entirely, which is a key element in explaining how the sharing economy functions. The translation loses some specificity about the mechanism of sharing.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes all key concepts from the original text, including the peer-to-peer aspect through ""makes it simple for people to share with each other."" Uses appropriate vocabulary for B1 level and maintains good readability.

Weaknesses: The sentence structure becomes slightly repetitive with multiple short sentences. The phrase ""sharing these underused items"" followed by another sentence about sharing creates minor redundancy.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Captures the main ideas and uses accessible vocabulary. The phrase ""this kind of sharing between people"" effectively conveys the peer-to-peer concept in simple terms. Maintains logical flow between ideas.

Weaknesses: Changes ""underused"" to ""unused"" which slightly alters the meaning - underused items may still have some use, while unused suggests no current use at all. The transition between sentences could be smoother.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for B1 level, maintains clear structure, and preserves the main concepts from the original text.
Weaknesses: Changes ""18th and 19th centuries"" to ""1800s and 1900s"" which creates a factual error (18th century is 1700s, not 1800s). The phrase ""random thoughts"" oversimplifies ""random activity in the brain"" and loses some meaning.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Correctly translates the centuries (1700s and 1800s), uses appropriate B1 vocabulary, includes paragraph breaks for better readability, and maintains the contrast between theories with ""very different.""
Weaknesses: Uses slightly more complex phrasing like ""turn these random thoughts into a story that makes sense"" which may be at the upper end of B1 level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains good vocabulary level for B1, preserves the meaning well with ""random thoughts and images,"" and includes clear contrast with ""very different.""
Weaknesses: Contains the same factual error as Model 1 by stating ""1800s and 1900s"" instead of correctly identifying the 18th century as the 1700s. The sentence structure is slightly more complex in some parts.

**Key Differences:**
Model 2 is the only translation that correctly identifies the time periods. Model 1 uses the simplest language but sacrifices some accuracy. Model 3 provides good detail but has the century error. All models successfully simplify the vocabulary while maintaining the core meaning, though Model 2 provides the most accurate factual information.

Weaknesses: ""Tea breaks"" changes the meaning from making individual cups of tea to scheduled breaks. The final sentence structure could be clearer about the connection between the office environment and improved focus.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses accessible vocabulary and sentence structures. ""Making tea"" accurately reflects the original meaning. The final paragraph clearly separates the benefits with simple, direct statements.
Weaknesses: ""Internet was slow"" doesn't fully capture that the Wi-Fi connection ""wasn't ideal"" - it may have had other issues beyond speed. The text ends somewhat abruptly without fully connecting the office benefits.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the original's flow and meaning most completely. ""Things that distracted me"" is clear and appropriate for B1 level. The relative clause ""where I could concentrate better"" effectively links the office environment to improved focus.
Weaknesses: Uses slightly more complex structures like ""which is great because"" and relative clauses that may be at the upper end of B1 level. ""My family needing my help"" is somewhat more complex than necessary.

Strengths: Clear and concise language appropriate for B1 level. Successfully simplifies complex concepts while maintaining the core message. Uses accessible vocabulary like ""finish this work"" instead of ""achieve its goal.""

Weaknesses: Omits the telescope's 0.5-metre specification and the technical term ""NEOs"" (Near-Earth Objects). Does not provide the full expansion of ""PHAs,"" which could leave readers unclear about the acronym's meaning.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains appropriate B1 vocabulary while preserving more technical accuracy. Changes ""middle-sized"" to ""medium-sized"" which is clearer. Provides the full expansion of PHAs, helping reader comprehension. Includes ""about ten years"" which softens the timeframe appropriately.

Weaknesses: Still omits the 0.5-metre telescope specification and the NEOs terminology. The phrase ""medium-sized asteroids"" loses the specific technical context of NEOs.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes ""probably"" which preserves the conditional nature of the original statement. Provides the full expansion of PHAs. Uses ""special space telescope"" to emphasize the telescope's unique purpose. Maintains the cautious tone of the original.

Weaknesses: Omits both the 0.5-metre specification and NEOs terminology. Uses ""asteroids"" generally rather than specifying the middle-sized/medium-sized category, which reduces precision compared to the other models.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for B1 level. Maintains the core narrative structure and key facts.
Weaknesses: Loses the opening concept about adventurers seeking multiple challenges (""Not content with one amazing trip""). Omits the detail about pulling the sledge ""behind her"" and doesn't capture the continuous nature of the journey (""having pulled"").

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Preserves the opening theme about seeking multiple challenges. Includes helpful B1-level explanations in parentheses for ""glacier"" and ""sledge."" Maintains all key details including the continuous action of pulling the sledge.
Weaknesses: Slightly longer and more complex than typical B1 text. The parenthetical explanations, while helpful, add length that may not be necessary for B1 learners.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Captures the opening concept effectively with ""aren't happy with just one exciting trip."" Uses ""cycled"" as a good B1 alternative to ""ridden a bike."" Maintains the narrative flow and includes the continuous action aspect.
Weaknesses: Uses ""sled"" instead of ""sledge,"" which changes the original terminology. The phrase ""aren't happy with just one"" is slightly more complex than needed for B1.

**Ranking Analysis:**
Model 2 best preserves the original meaning and structure while providing helpful clarification for B1 learners. Model 3 effectively captures the main ideas with appropriate simplification. Model 1, while simple, loses important thematic elements from the original text.

Strengths:
- Uses simple, clear sentence structures appropriate for B1 level
- Maintains the core message about the artist's evolution from rats to social issues
- Uses accessible vocabulary throughout

Weaknesses:
- Omits ""his home city"" information, losing contextual detail
- Removes ""different"" before social issues, slightly reducing meaning
- Changes ""encourage residents to think about the problem"" to ""make residents aware,"" which is less specific about the intended cognitive engagement

**Model 2 Analysis:**

Strengths:
- Retains the ""hometown"" detail from the original
- Adds ""For example"" as a connecting phrase, which aids B1 comprehension
- Maintains clear, simple sentence structure
- Includes ""important"" to emphasize the significance of social problems

Weaknesses:
- Changes ""encourage residents to think about the problem of homelessness"" to ""make residents aware of homelessness,"" losing the emphasis on active thinking and the specific framing as ""the problem""

**Model 3 Analysis:**

Strengths:
- Preserves ""hometown"" detail
- Uses ""images"" as a synonym for ""pictures,"" showing vocabulary variation
- Maintains ""important social problems"" 
- Keeps ""the issue of homelessness,"" preserving the original's emphasis on framing homelessness as a specific issue

Weaknesses:
- Still changes ""encourage residents to think"" to ""make residents aware,"" reducing the emphasis on active cognitive engagement
- Adds ""pictures of"" before ""rats"" which wasn't in the original

**Content Preservation Comparison:**
All models successfully simplify the language for B1 level while maintaining the basic narrative. Model 1 loses some contextual information, while Models 2 and 3 better preserve the original details.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and sentence structures appropriate for B1 level. The word ""random"" is retained and accessible. Clear and concise presentation.
Weaknesses: Changes ""councils"" to ""cities,"" which alters the meaning since councils are governing bodies, not cities themselves. Omits ""write"" when describing what artists can do in graffiti zones. Uses ""the city"" instead of ""the city council,"" losing specificity about who made the decision.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the concept of local government decision-making with ""local governments."" Preserves both ""paint and write"" activities. Includes ""freely"" which captures the spirit of the original. Uses appropriate B1-level vocabulary.
Weaknesses: Changes ""encourage artists not to paint graffiti randomly"" to ""stop artists from painting graffiti,"" which shifts the meaning from encouragement/redirection to prohibition. Uses ""the city has even let"" (past tense) instead of present perfect, slightly changing the temporal aspect.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the governmental aspect with ""local governments."" Preserves both ""paint and write"" activities. Includes ""freely"" from the original. Uses present tense ""lets"" which better matches the ongoing nature of the policy.
Weaknesses: Like Model 2, changes ""encourage artists not to paint graffiti randomly"" to ""stop artists from painting graffiti,"" altering the original meaning from positive encouragement to negative prevention.

**Key Differences:**
Models 2 and 3 are nearly identical, with Model 3 using ""lets"" (present) versus Model 2's ""let"" (past). Model 1 is more concise but loses some accuracy. All models successfully simplify the language for B1 level, but they vary in how faithfully they preserve the original meaning.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level. Maintains the core meaning about temporary nature of street art and life changes. Good use of basic vocabulary like ""washed away by rain.""

Weaknesses: Changes ""pavements"" to ""streets"" which alters the specific meaning. Loses the phrase ""explore different locations"" which becomes just ""working in different places."" The connection between temporary art and life's cycles is somewhat simplified.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Adds helpful context by explicitly identifying Faith47 as ""an artist."" Maintains ""sidewalks"" as accurate equivalent to ""pavements."" Preserves the concept of exploring different locations with ""often in different places."" Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary throughout.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""city workers cleaning it up"" is slightly more complex than necessary. The sentence structure in some parts could be simpler for B1 level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very clear, simple sentence structures ideal for B1 level. Maintains ""sidewalks"" for accuracy. The phrase ""doesn't last forever"" is accessible and natural. Good use of basic connecting words.

Weaknesses: Loses the concept of ""exploring different locations"" entirely. Changes ""new beginnings"" to ""new things starting"" which is less precise. The philosophical connection between art and life cycles is somewhat diminished.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level. Successfully conveys the main contrast between the two work cultures. The phrase ""without question"" effectively captures the concept of unquestioned authority.

Weaknesses: Loses the technical terminology ""high/low power distance culture"" which may be important for understanding workplace concepts. The phrase ""even challenge ideas"" is somewhat vague compared to the original's more specific meaning.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains clear, accessible language while preserving key concepts like ""hierarchy"" and ""equal work environment."" The structure flows logically and uses appropriate B1 vocabulary. ""Share their opinions"" is a clear way to express the collaborative aspect.

Weaknesses: Slightly less specific about the mentoring role of leaders compared to other versions. The contrast between the two cultures could be more explicitly stated.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses concrete, simple language that clearly explains both work cultures. The phrase ""followed rules strictly"" adds clarity about the hierarchical nature. The dash usage effectively explains the coaching role. ""Open to being questioned"" directly corresponds to the original meaning.

Weaknesses: ""Followed rules strictly"" slightly shifts the focus from authority respect to rule-following, which isn't quite the same concept as power distance.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level. Maintains the core information about the brothers and their work. The sentence structure is straightforward and accessible.

Weaknesses: Omits the important detail that they are ""identical"" twins, which is specified in the original. The phrase ""so they use cranes to help"" is slightly awkward and doesn't clearly explain why cranes are needed.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes the key detail about the twins looking ""exactly the same"" (equivalent to identical). Uses B1-appropriate vocabulary while maintaining accuracy. The explanation ""to reach high places"" clearly shows why cranes are needed.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""cranes to reach high places"" assumes readers know what cranes are, which may not be suitable for all B1 learners.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes the identical twin detail through ""look exactly the same."" Provides the clearest explanation by defining cranes as ""special machines called cranes,"" which helps B1 learners understand unfamiliar vocabulary. Maintains all key information from the original.

Weaknesses: The explanation of cranes, while helpful, makes the sentence slightly longer and could be considered over-explanatory for some B1 learners.

Weaknesses: ""The Games"" assumes prior knowledge that may not be clear to all readers. ""Offers to take her place"" is slightly less precise than ""volunteers."" The final sentence about the relationship is somewhat abrupt.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful context by explaining the selection as ""a dangerous competition"" rather than assuming knowledge. Uses clear B1-appropriate vocabulary. The phrase ""difficult and confusing relationship"" adds descriptive detail that aids comprehension.

Weaknesses: The text structure creates a paragraph break that wasn't in the original, which changes the flow slightly.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the original single-paragraph structure. Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary and clear sentence construction. Includes the helpful context of ""dangerous competition"" like Model 2.

Weaknesses: The description of the relationship as simply ""difficult"" is less detailed than other versions, potentially losing some nuance from the original ""complicated.""

**Comparison:**
All three models successfully simplify vocabulary (changing ""heroine"" to ""main character,"" ""skilful"" to ""very good,"" ""tributes"" to more accessible terms). Model 2 and 3 both improve clarity by explaining the nature of the competition. Model 1 maintains the most concise approach but sacrifices some clarity. Model 2 provides the most comprehensive emotional context with ""difficult and confusing."" Model 3 balances structure preservation with clarity improvements.

Strengths: Uses simple sentence structures appropriate for B1 level. Maintains the core meaning of the original text. Uses clear, straightforward vocabulary.
Weaknesses: Omits ""about them"" after ""more details,"" making the reference less clear. The phrase ""connect to your daily life and feelings"" changes the original structure by placing ""feelings"" at the end rather than maintaining the ""events and feelings"" pairing.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes ""about them"" for clearer reference. Maintains the conditional ""might help"" from the original. Expands ""daily life"" to ""things that happen in your daily life"" for better B1 comprehension. Separates ""things that happen"" and ""how you feel"" for clarity.
Weaknesses: The expansion makes some sentences slightly longer, though still within B1 range.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses ""When you write down"" instead of ""If you write down,"" providing slight variety while maintaining meaning. Includes ""about them"" for clear reference. Expands ""what the dream means"" for better clarity. Separates events and feelings into ""things that happen in your daily life and how you feel.""
Weaknesses: The change from ""if"" to ""when"" slightly alters the conditional nature of the original statement, though the meaning remains largely intact.

All three models successfully simplify the original text for B1 level while preserving the main ideas. They use appropriate vocabulary and sentence structures. The key differences lie in clarity of references, handling of conditional statements, and how they break down complex concepts.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level. Successfully simplifies ""susceptible to fire"" to ""could easily catch fire."" Maintains the core meaning while using accessible vocabulary.
Weaknesses: Changes ""more bridges"" to ""many bridges,"" which slightly alters the comparative meaning. Uses ""burn the bridge completely"" instead of more natural phrasing.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Effectively simplifies complex vocabulary while preserving meaning. Uses natural B1-level expressions like ""built with wood"" and ""burn down."" Maintains good sentence flow and readability.
Weaknesses: Changes ""more bridges"" to ""most bridges,"" which significantly alters the original meaning from a comparative statement to an absolute one.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Preserves the comparative element with ""much easier,"" which better reflects the original's ""much more susceptible."" Uses natural phrasing with ""burn down."" Maintains appropriate B1 vocabulary level.
Weaknesses: Like Model 2, changes ""more bridges"" to ""most bridges,"" altering the comparative nature of the original statement.

All three models successfully adapt the vocabulary and sentence structure for B1 level learners. However, they differ in how accurately they preserve the original meaning, particularly regarding the comparative nature of the opening statement and the naturalness of their word choices.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and sentence structures appropriate for B1 level. Maintains the core message and covers all main points from the original text. The phrase ""here to stay"" is preserved effectively.

Weaknesses: Some simplification results in less precise meaning - ""area"" instead of ""neighbourhood"" loses specificity. The phrase ""starting to see street art as real art"" is somewhat informal compared to the original's ""legitimate art form.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains good vocabulary level while being accessible. Preserves key phrases like ""more and more artists"" and ""neighborhoods."" Includes transitional phrases like ""In addition"" and ""Even though"" which help text flow. The ending ""it's not going away"" effectively conveys the original meaning.

Weaknesses: Slightly longer than necessary for B1 level. Some phrases like ""real and important form of art"" add words that weren't in the original.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Good balance of simplicity and completeness. Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary and maintains most key information. The addition of ""not just something on the streets"" provides helpful clarification for the concept.

Weaknesses: Omits the specific mention of ""neighbourhood"" by only using ""cities."" The explanatory addition about street art being ""not just something on the streets"" changes the original meaning slightly.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three models successfully adapt the text to B1 level while preserving the main ideas. Model 2 provides the most complete coverage of the original content with appropriate language complexity.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for B1 level (""felt sad,"" ""scared her very much""). The sentence structure is straightforward and accessible.
Weaknesses: Changes ""upsetting"" to ""sad,"" which loses some emotional intensity. Omits ""programmes"" and simplifies to just ""news,"" losing specificity. Changes ""frightening experience"" to ""scared her very much,"" which is less precise. Uses simple past tense throughout, losing the present perfect aspect that indicates ongoing relevance.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the present perfect tense (""has always felt""), preserving the ongoing nature of the feeling. Includes ""news reports,"" maintaining more specificity than Model 1. Uses ""sad and worried"" to better capture the emotional range.
Weaknesses: Adds ""Vietnam War"" instead of just ""Vietnam,"" which is acceptable but changes the original phrasing. The phrase ""keep her safe"" is somewhat interpretive compared to ""protect her.""

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains ""upsetting"" from the original text, maintaining the specific emotional tone. Preserves ""tried to protect her,"" staying closer to the original wording.

Strengths: Maintains factual accuracy and preserves all key information from the original. Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level. The sentence structure is straightforward and accessible.

Weaknesses: Loses the term ""multi-adventurer"" by simplifying to just ""adventurer."" The phrase ""What makes this amazing"" is somewhat awkward compared to the original's flow.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains factual accuracy and includes all essential information. Uses ""even more impressive"" which adds emphasis appropriately. The addition of ""to inspire them"" at the end provides clear purpose for the climbing trips.

Weaknesses: Changes ""United States"" to ""USA"" without clear B1 simplification benefit. The phrase ""he also helps people"" slightly shifts the meaning from ""encourage"" to ""helps.""

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Adds descriptive elements like ""hot deserts"" and ""exciting challenges"" that can aid B1 comprehension. Provides the most complete explanation of Erik's motivational work with the phrase ""to show them what they can achieve."" Uses clear, motivational language.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level. The sentence structure is straightforward and easy to follow. Successfully conveys the main concept of online selling being more convenient than physical markets.

Weaknesses: Omits several key details from the original text, including the specific mention of ""hardly worn"" clothes, ""car boot sale,"" and the concept that children have ""outgrown"" items. The phrase ""democratised online platforms"" is simplified to just ""online platforms,"" losing some meaning. Does not capture the investment aspect mentioned in the original.

Strengths: Uses clear, simple language appropriate for B1 level. ""Protecting Earth"" is an accessible way to explain ""planetary defence."" The sentence structure is straightforward and easy to follow.

Weaknesses: ""Earth's path"" is less precise than ""Earth's orbit"" and could be confusing. The translation loses some technical accuracy by oversimplifying certain terms.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains good technical accuracy while using B1-appropriate vocabulary. ""Earth's path around the Sun"" clearly explains orbital mechanics. The phrase ""space threats"" effectively conveys the concept of planetary defence. Includes helpful clarification about ""large asteroids.""

Weaknesses: Slightly longer sentences that approach the upper limit of B1 complexity. Some phrases could be simplified further.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level. Maintains the core narrative structure and key plot points. The vocabulary choices like ""whisper"" and ""get sick"" are accessible.

Weaknesses: Loses some important details from the original, such as the specific reference to ""the plague"" concept and the ""traumatic"" nature of the camp event. The phrase ""something unexpected and very sad"" doesn't fully capture the intensity of ""traumatic.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Preserves more of the original's meaning while using B1-appropriate language. Good use of connecting words like ""However"" and ""Throughout."" Maintains the emotional progression of the story well.

Weaknesses: Changes ""school camp"" to ""school trip,"" which alters a specific detail. Uses ""upsetting"" instead of conveying the traumatic nature, though this may be appropriate for B1 level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Keeps ""school camp"" accurate to the original text. Uses clear, simple language suitable for B1 level. Good balance between simplification and detail retention. The phrase ""very surprising and upsetting"" captures more of the original's intensity than other versions.

Weaknesses: Minor repetition with ""Auggie"" in the final paragraph that could have been avoided with a pronoun.

All three models successfully simplify the complex vocabulary and sentence structures while maintaining the story's essence. They appropriately replace difficult terms like ""agonising"" and handle the ""plague"" reference sensitively. The main differences lie in detail retention and word choice precision.

Strengths:
- Uses simple, clear vocabulary appropriate for B1 level
- Maintains the key factual information about climber numbers and ages
- Simplifies complex phrases effectively (""freezing conditions"" → ""cold weather"")

Weaknesses:
- Loses the concessive relationship in the original (""Though..."") by breaking it into separate sentences
- ""loved climbing when she was young"" is less precise than the original ""fell in love with mountain climbing as a teenager""
- Omits ""the world's"" before ""best climbers""

**Model 2 Analysis:**

Strengths:
- Preserves the concessive structure with ""Even though""
- Uses ""Mount Everest"" which adds clarity
- Maintains the teenager reference accurately
- Uses ""continued climbing"" which effectively conveys ongoing action

Weaknesses:
- Changes ""climbers"" to ""people"" in the first sentence, losing specificity

Strengths: Uses simple sentence structure appropriate for B1 level. Successfully simplifies ""oxygen tanks"" to ""extra oxygen"" and ""low oxygen levels"" to ""thin air."" Maintains all key information from the original.

Weaknesses: Opens with two separate sentences instead of maintaining the participial phrase connection. Uses ""harm"" which may be slightly strong compared to the original's ""affect.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Preserves the temporal relationship with ""After climbing Mount Everest."" Provides clear explanation of the oxygen danger. Maintains the complete charity description. Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary throughout.

Weaknesses: Includes ""Mount"" before Everest, which wasn't in the original. The phrase ""even harder"" adds emphasis not present in the source text.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains temporal connection with ""After climbing Everest."" Provides the most accurate explanation of the physiological effects with ""make it hard for the brain and body to work properly,"" which closely matches the original's ""affect brain and body functioning."" Uses ""success"" instead of ""fame,"" offering vocabulary variation.

Weaknesses: Like Model 2, adds ""even harder"" which intensifies beyond the original. Changes ""fame"" to ""success,"" which slightly alters the meaning since fame specifically relates to public recognition.

**Ranking Assessment:**
Model 3 provides the most accurate representation of the physiological effects and maintains appropriate B1 complexity.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for B1 level. The examples are clear and relatable.
Weaknesses: Changes the original structure significantly by starting with an imperative (""Look around"") rather than maintaining the conditional structure. Loses some nuance from the original, such as ""trendy"" becoming just ""nice"" and omitting the phrase ""at some point in our lives.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the conditional structure of the original (""If we look at...""). Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary while preserving most of the original meaning. Includes the time reference ""over the years"" which captures the original's ""at some point in our lives.""
Weaknesses: Uses ""heavy winter coat"" instead of just describing it as thick and woollen, which slightly changes the meaning. The phrase ""instead"" at the end is unnecessary and makes the sentence slightly awkward.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the conditional structure and preserves the original meaning well. Uses clear B1-level vocabulary. The sentence structure flows naturally and maintains the logical progression of the original.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level. The sentence structure is straightforward and easy to follow. Successfully conveys the main ideas without unnecessary complexity.

Weaknesses: Omits the specific mention of ""across cultures"" which loses some of the original meaning. The phrase ""special knowledge"" is less precise than the original's ""knowledge or insight."" The translation is somewhat abbreviated compared to the original.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the cultural aspect with ""in many cultures."" Preserves the specific examples from the original (place, person, event) with clear enumeration. Uses appropriate B1-level vocabulary while retaining most of the original's meaning. The structure closely follows the original text.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""that dream actually happened"" is slightly awkward phrasing. Could be more concise in some areas.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes the cultural context effectively. Maintains the specific examples from the original text. Uses simple past tense consistently, which may be clearer for B1 learners. The phrase ""it really happened"" sounds more natural than Model 2's equivalent.

Weaknesses: Uses ""gods"" instead of ""the gods,"" which changes the meaning slightly. The overall structure is good but has minor grammatical inconsistencies.

Strengths: Uses appropriate B1-level vocabulary and maintains clear sentence structure. Successfully simplifies ""terrain"" to ""areas"" and ""media interest"" to ""attention."" The phrase ""speak out against"" is accessible at B1 level.

Weaknesses: Loses the specific detail ""media interest"" by shortening it to just ""attention,"" which changes the meaning slightly. The phrase ""could not have walked"" is less natural than contractions typically used at B1 level.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses natural contractions appropriate for B1 level. Maintains the concept of ""media attention"" which preserves the original meaning. Simplifies ""destruction"" to ""damage"" and ""raise money"" to ""collect money,"" both suitable for B1 vocabulary.

Weaknesses: Changes ""his walk"" to ""finished his walk,"" adding information not present in the original. ""Environmental groups"" is less specific than the original ""environmental...charities.""

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses natural contractions and clear B1-level vocabulary. Effectively simplifies ""terrain"" to ""parts of the forest,"" which is more descriptive and accessible. Maintains ""media attention"" from the original meaning. The phrase ""charities that help the environment and children"" clearly explains the concept.

Weaknesses: ""Done his walk"" is less precise than the original concept. The restructured charity description, while clearer, is wordier than necessary.

All three models successfully adapt the text to B1 level by using simpler vocabulary, shorter sentences, and more accessible phrasing. Model 2 and Model 3 better preserve the ""media"" aspect of the attention Ed received. Model 3 provides the clearest explanation of the charity types, while Model 2 maintains better fidelity to the original structure.

Strengths: Maintains clear structure and covers all main points from the original. Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary like ""crash,"" ""huge size,"" and ""weak spots."" The sentence flow is natural and easy to follow.

Weaknesses: ""New technologies can find weak spots"" loses some specificity compared to ""detect structural weakness."" The phrase ""safer workplaces"" is less precise than ""safer working environments"" in this bridge construction context.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Opens with a clear topic sentence that explicitly states what the text is about. Uses simple, accessible language appropriate for B1 level. Breaks information into shorter, digestible sentences which aids comprehension.

Weaknesses: The sentence structure becomes choppy due to excessive breaking of compound sentences. ""Work conditions"" is less formal than the original ""working environments."" Some flow is lost in the paragraph break.

Strengths: Uses ""regularly"" which accurately conveys ""periodically,"" maintains the scientific precision with ""does not last long—only a few hundred years,"" and preserves the breathing metaphor effectively. The phrase ""key part"" appropriately translates ""key ingredient.""

Weaknesses: Minor loss of specificity in some word choices, but overall maintains the original meaning well.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses ""from time to time"" which captures the periodic nature, includes the clarification ""it only stays in the air for a few hundred years"" which adds helpful context for B1 readers, and uses ""main part"" which is clear and appropriate.

Weaknesses: The added phrase ""stays in the air"" slightly changes the original meaning, as methane's survival isn't specifically about remaining airborne but about molecular stability.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses ""from time to time"" effectively, employs ""important part"" which conveys the significance well, and changes ""seasonal intervals in the year"" to ""during different seasons"" which is clearer for B1 level.

Weaknesses: Uses ""doesn't last very long"" which is less precise than the other models' phrasing, and the addition of ""very"" makes it sound more colloquial than scientific.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three models successfully simplify the vocabulary and sentence structure for B1 level while preserving the core scientific information. Model 1 maintains the most precise language while remaining accessible. Model 2 adds helpful clarification but slightly alters meaning. Model 3 provides good simplification but loses some precision in key phrases.

Strengths: Clear and accessible language appropriate for B1 level. Successfully conveys the main ideas about parental influence and multitasking behavior. The example about teenagers meeting but engaging in separate online conversations is well preserved.

Weaknesses: Loses the idiomatic expression ""hit the nail on the head"" without replacement. Omits the specific detail about ""waiting at a red light"" and simplifies ""posting on social media"" to just ""use their phones."" The phrase ""try to do many things at once"" doesn't fully capture the original concept of wanting to be in multiple places simultaneously.

The translation is overly simplified and loses some nuance.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains more detail from the original text, including the education and training aspect of projects. Uses accessible vocabulary while maintaining most key information. Preserves the geographic context about Bangladesh being coastal and flat.
Weaknesses: Misses the phrase ""once too often"" which indicates the frequency of project failures. The phrase ""aid projects"" is less specific than ""humanitarian campaigns"" from the original.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Captures most essential information from the original text. Uses ""fighting for human rights"" which conveys strong commitment. Includes the educational aspect by mentioning ""teaching them new skills."" Maintains the geographic and cultural context effectively.
Weaknesses: Uses ""fighting for"" instead of ""dedicated her life to supporting,"" which slightly changes the tone. Like Model 2, misses the ""once too often"" detail and uses ""aid projects"" instead of ""humanitarian campaigns.""

All three models successfully simplify the complex sentence structure of the original while maintaining B1-appropriate vocabulary. However, they vary in how much detail they preserve from the source text.

Also, six million fewer children die from diseases every year, millions more girls are going to school, and many more people now have clean water to drink.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level. Maintains the core message and statistical information accurately. The sentence structure is straightforward and accessible.

Weaknesses: Loses some nuance by simplifying ""dictators"" to ""bad leaders."" The phrase ""things are improving"" is less impactful than the original's emphasis on transformation. Removes the colon structure that helps organize the ideas in the original.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Preserves the colon structure from the original, which aids comprehension. Uses ""changing for the better"" which captures the positive transformation concept well. Adds ""to drink"" for clarity about clean water usage.

Weaknesses: Uses ""improvement"" twice in close proximity, which could be repetitive. The phrase ""bad leaders"" still doesn't capture the severity of ""dictators"" mentioned in the original.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains ""dictators"" from the original text, maintaining the stronger political context. Uses ""changing a lot"" which effectively conveys the magnitude of transformation. Preserves the colon structure and includes helpful clarifications like ""to drink.""

Weaknesses: The phrase ""are no longer poor"" is slightly less precise than ""escaped poverty."" Uses ""very"" multiple times, which could sound repetitive.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three models successfully adapt the text to B1 level while preserving the main arguments and statistics. Model 3 maintains more of the original's political context and emphasis on significant change. Model 2 provides good structural clarity and natural phrasing. Model 1, while clear and simple, loses some important nuances from the source text.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and sentence structures appropriate for B1 level. Maintains the core message about the sandwich method's problems and the proper use of positive feedback.

Weaknesses: Contains a significant error in the opening sentence - states managers put ""negative comments between two positive ones"" when it should be the reverse. Omits the concept that this becomes a ""routine"" and loses some nuance about reinforcing good performance.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Correctly describes the sandwich method. Introduces the term ""sandwich method"" which aids comprehension. Includes the important detail about routine use (""used too often""). Maintains clear B1-level language while preserving the main arguments. Adds a concluding sentence that reinforces the message.

Weaknesses: Slightly longer than necessary for B1 level, though still accessible.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Accurately describes the sandwich method. Uses ""workers"" as a simpler alternative to ""employees."" Maintains clear, simple sentence structures appropriate for B1 level. Preserves the key concepts about perception and meaningfulness.

Weaknesses: Uses ""make the negative ones seem better"" which is less precise than explaining the hiding/cushioning concept. The phrase ""make negative feedback easier to hear"" is somewhat simplified compared to the original meaning.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and sentence structures appropriate for B1 level. Successfully conveys the main message about autonomous weapons being dangerous.
Weaknesses: Omits the specific ""Terminator"" reference which provides important context. Loses the distinction between current weapons and future ""murderbots."" The phrase ""killing people"" is more direct but loses some nuance of the original's ""being used to kill.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains the ""Terminator"" reference which helps readers understand the movie context. Maintains the distinction between current military machines and future autonomous robots. Uses ""automated guns"" which effectively simplifies ""gun turrets and sentry robots."" Preserves the progression from current to future technology.
Weaknesses: ""Extremely careful"" may be slightly more advanced than necessary for B1 level compared to ""very careful.""

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses accessible language and maintains the core message. The phrase ""robots with guns"" is clear and concrete for B1 learners. ""For all of us"" personalizes the danger effectively.
Weaknesses: ""Scary robots from movies that crush people"" is less specific than referencing the Terminator, losing cultural context. ""Robots with guns"" is somewhat imprecise compared to the original's specific military equipment types.

**Ranking Assessment:**
Model 2 provides the most complete adaptation while maintaining B1 accessibility. It preserves key details like the Terminator reference and the technological progression. Model 3 follows closely with good simplification but loses some specificity. Model 1, while clear, omits important contextual elements.

Strengths: Maintains the ""feedback sandwich"" terminology with quotation marks, preserving the original concept. Uses simpler vocabulary appropriate for B1 level (""talk about"" instead of ""have a word""). Keeps the three-part structure of the feedback sandwich clear.

Weaknesses: Loses some nuance by omitting ""obligatory praise"" and simplifies ""what they really want to say"" to just ""the bad part."" The explanation of the feedback sandwich is somewhat abbreviated.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very accessible B1 vocabulary throughout. Clearly explains the feedback sandwich concept without using the specific term, making it more comprehensible. The phrase ""to make it better"" adds helpful clarification.

Weaknesses: Completely removes the ""feedback sandwich"" terminology, which is a key concept from the original. The phrase ""usual way people give feedback"" is less precise than the original concept. Loses the specific structure explanation.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains the ""feedback sandwich"" term with quotation marks. Includes the complete three-step explanation at the end, closely matching the original structure. Maintains the concept of ""what you really think"" which preserves the original meaning.

Strengths: Includes clearer explanation with ""not in real life"" which helps B1 readers understand the distinction. Uses accessible vocabulary like ""tough neighborhood."" Maintains good flow and readability.
Weaknesses: Missing ""best-selling"" descriptor. Doesn't specify it was a housing estate or that it had the highest crime rate. The addition of ""not in real life"" while helpful, slightly changes the original's implication.

Strengths: Maintains the original's rhetorical questions and core message effectively. Uses simpler vocabulary (""says"" instead of ""argues"") and replaces ""demagogues"" with the more accessible ""leaders."" The sentence structure remains clear and readable.

Weaknesses: Changes the word order from ""longer, healthier, freer and happier"" to ""longer, healthier, happier, and freer"" without clear justification. Omits ""irreparable damage"" and simplifies to just ""harm,"" losing some meaning intensity. The term ""tribalism"" remains unexplained, which may be challenging for B1 learners.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for B1 level, maintains clear structure, and successfully conveys the main problem of banana diseases affecting two varieties.

Weaknesses: Loses important details about United Fruit being both grower and exporter, oversimplifies the cloning process by not explaining what ""shoots"" are, and omits the mass production efficiency aspect that was central to the original text.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides the most complete information retention, clearly explains the cloning process (""took small parts from the stems""), maintains the connection between United Fruit's role as both grower and seller, and uses appropriate B1 vocabulary while preserving technical concepts.

Weaknesses: Slightly longer than necessary for B1 level, and the phrase ""special method"" could be more specific.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very accessible language for B1 learners, maintains the efficiency concept from the original, and presents information in a logical flow.

Weaknesses: Oversimplifies the cloning process to ""used parts of the plant to make new ones"" without sufficient explanation, reduces ""commercial banana growers"" to just ""banana companies"" which changes the meaning, and loses the specific detail about United Fruit being an exporter.

**Ranking Assessment:**
Model 2 preserves the most essential information while maintaining B1 accessibility. Model 3 follows with good simplification but loses some important details. Model 1 ranks last due to significant information loss and unclear explanations.

Strengths: Concise and clear language appropriate for B1 level. Successfully simplifies complex concepts while maintaining accuracy. Good use of ""for example"" to introduce the Sydney funnel-web spider case.

Weaknesses: Omits the explanation of what anti-venom is, which may leave B1 learners unclear about this medical term. The phrase ""shoot out tiny hairs"" could be more precise about the mechanism.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful explanation of anti-venom as ""medicine,"" making the text more accessible to B1 learners. Includes more complete information about the hairs sticking to skin/eyes and causing discomfort. Maintains good sentence structure and vocabulary level.

Weaknesses: Slightly longer than necessary for B1 level, though still manageable. The phrase ""dangerous Sydney funnel-web spider"" adds an adjective not essential for comprehension.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Clear explanation of anti-venom as ""special medicine."" Good use of ""scared"" instead of ""threatened,"" which is more familiar vocabulary for B1 learners. Maintains the key information about the defensive mechanism.

Weaknesses: Uses ""cause problems"" which is vague compared to the more specific ""cause discomfort"" in Model 2. The phrase ""dangerous Sydney funnel-web spider"" is included but doesn't add significant value for B1 comprehension.

Strengths: Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary with ""common,"" ""shy,"" ""innocent,"" and ""survives."" The sentence structure is clear and accessible. Successfully conveys the main narrative arc.
Weaknesses: ""Horror movie idea"" doesn't accurately capture ""cliché"" - it's more about a recurring pattern than just an idea. Omits the key detail that the girl becomes ""the toughest and most resourceful person in the world,"" instead using the less precise ""bravest and smartest person.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains good B1-level vocabulary and sentence complexity. Includes the important detail ""fighting to survive"" which adds context. Preserves the ""almost always"" qualifier from the original. Uses ""scene"" which, while not perfect, suggests a recognizable pattern.
Weaknesses: ""Horror movie scene"" is imprecise - this refers to a narrative structure, not a single scene. The phrase ""bravest and smartest person"" doesn't fully capture ""toughest and most resourceful person in the world.""

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses ""scary movie"" which is very accessible for B1 learners. ""Late 1900s"" is a clear way to express ""late 20th century."" Includes ""almost always"" and maintains the narrative progression well. ""Most clever"" is appropriate B1 vocabulary.
Weaknesses: ""Scary movie idea"" has the same issue as Model 1 - doesn't capture the concept of a cliché. ""Everyone dies"" is less natural than ""everyone is dead."" Missing the emphasis that she becomes the toughest person ""in the world.""

**Overall Assessment:**
All three models successfully simplify the vocabulary and sentence structure for B1 level. However, all struggle with translating ""cliché"" appropriately and fail to fully convey that the girl becomes exceptionally capable (emphasized by ""in the world"" in the original).

If you always mix good and bad comments together, people might not value the good things you say. Sometimes, just give positive feedback without adding any criticism. Try to avoid the urge to always point out what needs to improve.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses clear, direct language appropriate for B1 level. Maintains the core message effectively. The sentence structure is simple and accessible.
Weaknesses: Loses some nuance from the original, particularly the phrase ""for its own sake"" and ""constructive criticism."" The translation is somewhat mechanical and lacks the explanatory depth of the original.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains good clarity while preserving more of the original's explanatory tone. The phrase ""urge to point out mistakes"" effectively conveys the original's ""temptation."" Uses accessible vocabulary while keeping the message complete.
Weaknesses: The phrase ""saying something nice"" is more casual than the original tone. Could be slightly more precise in terminology.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Preserves the structure and flow of the original well. Uses clear, B1-appropriate language. The phrase ""what needs to improve"" is a good simplification of constructive feedback concepts.
Weaknesses: The ending phrase ""always point out what needs to improve"" adds the word ""always"" which wasn't in the original, slightly changing the meaning. Less precise than Model 2 in conveying the specific concept of pointing out mistakes.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three models successfully simplify the language to B1 level while maintaining the core message. Model 2 provides the most balanced approach between accessibility and completeness. Model 1 is the most concise but loses some meaning. Model 3 is clear but introduces a slight meaning change.
