Strengths: Uses simple, clear vocabulary appropriate for B1 level. The phrase ""give you ideas about things"" effectively simplifies ""insights into things."" The sentence structure is straightforward and accessible.
Weaknesses: Changes ""exactly what they mean"" to ""what a dream means,"" losing some precision from the original. The dash formatting for listing dreams differs from the original parenthetical structure.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: ""Clues about thoughts you didn't know you had"" is a clear B1-level adaptation. Maintains the logical flow with ""However"" as a transition. Uses appropriate vocabulary throughout.
Weaknesses: Adds ""basic meaning"" which wasn't in the original text. Changes ""exactly what they mean"" to ""what a dream really means,"" altering the emphasis slightly.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses ""clues about thoughts you didn't know you had"" effectively for B1 level. Preserves ""exactly what"" from the original text. Maintains ""But"" as the transition word matching the original. Keeps ""events and feelings"" intact from the source.
Weaknesses: Minor vocabulary choices could potentially be simplified further, though still appropriate for B1.

**Comparison:**
All three translations successfully adapt the content to B1 level. Model 1 uses the simplest language but makes more structural changes. Model 2 adds content not present in the original. Model 3 stays closest to the original structure and meaning while still achieving appropriate simplification.

A movie is being made, and many people, including me, are excited to see what RJ Palacio writes next.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains clear, simple language appropriate for B1 level. Preserves the original meaning accurately. Uses ""facial differences"" which is more sensitive terminology than the original ""deformities.""

Weaknesses: Changes ""explains"" to ""says"" which slightly reduces formality. Removes ""already"" from the awards sentence, losing some temporal emphasis.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Adds helpful parenthetical explanations (""a serious change in the shape of her face"" and ""a very popular book"") which support B1 comprehension. Retains ""already"" and ""eagerly"" from the original text. Maintains the complete meaning.

Weaknesses: The parenthetical additions make sentences longer and potentially more complex. The explanation of ""facial deformities"" is somewhat clinical and could be simplified further.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides clear explanation of ""facial deformity"" with additional context about it being a medical condition. Restructures ""New Yorker RJ Palacio"" to ""RJ Palacio, who lives in New York"" for better B1 comprehension. Changes ""novel"" to ""book"" which is simpler vocabulary.

Weaknesses: Loses ""already"" from the awards sentence. Changes ""bestseller"" to ""sold many copies"" which loses the specific meaning of the term. The sentence about the author's location becomes longer and more complex.

**Overall Assessment:**
Model 2 provides the most comprehensive support for B1 learners through its explanatory additions while maintaining fidelity to the original text. Model 1 offers the cleanest simplification with good sensitivity to language choices. Model 3 makes helpful structural changes but loses some specific meanings in the process.

Strengths: Maintains clear, simple sentence structure appropriate for B1 level. Successfully simplifies complex phrases like ""lost count of the times she's patiently tried"" to ""tried many times."" Preserves all key information from the original text.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""react badly"" is repeated without simplification, which may be challenging for B1 learners. Some vocabulary choices like ""affectionate"" remain at the original level without adaptation.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful vocabulary support by including original words in parentheses (affectionate, intelligent). Uses ""called"" instead of just naming the rats, which adds clarity. Replaces ""had babies"" with ""gave birth to babies"" for clearer understanding.

Weaknesses: The parenthetical explanations may interrupt reading flow. Some sentences become slightly longer due to added explanatory elements, potentially increasing complexity rather than reducing it.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Effectively combines sentences using coordinating conjunctions, maintaining natural flow while keeping language accessible. Provides vocabulary support through parentheses. Uses ""loving"" as a simpler alternative to ""affectionate.""

Weaknesses: The phrase ""many people do not like rats"" slightly changes the meaning from ""react badly"" to a more general dislike. The sentence combining sometimes creates longer, more complex structures that may challenge B1 learners.

**Overall Assessment:**
Model 1 provides the most consistent B1-level simplification with clear, direct language. Model 2 offers useful vocabulary support but may overcomplicate with explanations. Model 3 attempts good vocabulary adaptation but creates some structural complexity that works against B1 accessibility.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear vocabulary appropriate for B1 level. Maintains the core meaning while simplifying complex terms effectively. The sentence structure is straightforward and accessible.

Weaknesses: Omits some explanatory details that could help B1 learners understand concepts. ""This plan has worked a little"" is somewhat vague compared to ""has had some success."" The final sentence loses some nuance about baboons viewing the city as a food source.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful explanations in parentheses for potentially difficult concepts (""electrocuted"" and ""endangered species""). Maintains most of the original meaning while using B1-appropriate vocabulary. Good balance between simplification and comprehensiveness.

Weaknesses: The parenthetical explanations, while helpful, may interrupt reading flow. Some word choices like ""lower problems"" are slightly awkward compared to more natural alternatives.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes useful explanatory information about endangered species using a dash format. Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary while maintaining clarity. The explanation flows well within the sentence structure.

Weaknesses: Contains a factual error in the parenthetical explanation - ""electrocuted (killed by electricity)"" when the original and context suggest injury, not necessarily death. Uses ""fights"" instead of ""conflicts,"" which changes the tone and meaning slightly. ""Power cables"" maintains more technical language than necessary for B1.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three models successfully adapt the text to B1 level by simplifying vocabulary and sentence structures. Model 2 provides the most comprehensive explanations while maintaining accuracy. Model 1 offers the cleanest simplification but sacrifices some detail. Model 3 has good explanatory elements but contains a significant factual error in its definition.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Effectively balances simplification with preservation of original meaning. Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary while maintaining the text's professional tone. The parenthetical explanation for ""project basis"" is well-placed and helpful. Retains ""downside"" from the original, which is appropriate for B1 level.

Weaknesses: Contains one contraction (""don't"") while the rest of the text uses full forms, creating slight inconsistency. The parenthetical explanation, though useful, adds length to the sentence.

Strengths: Uses simpler vocabulary appropriate for B1 level (""show"" instead of ""bombard,"" ""big brands"" instead of ""major brands""). Maintains clear sentence structure and preserves the key message about disposable fashion.

Weaknesses: Loses the intensity of ""bombard"" which conveys the overwhelming nature of advertising. The phrase ""without thinking"" is somewhat abrupt compared to the original context.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains more of the original sentence structure and maintains the causal relationship between cheap clothes and disposable behavior. The addition of ""meaning"" helps clarify the concept for B1 learners.

Weaknesses: Uses more complex vocabulary that may be challenging for B1 level (""purchase"" instead of ""buy""). The sentence structure remains quite complex with multiple clauses.

Weaknesses: The parenthetical explanations may interrupt reading flow and could be considered over-scaffolding for B1 level. Some readers might find the annotations distracting.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses clear, simple language appropriate for B1 level. Maintains good narrative flow. Provides a helpful clarification for ""atlas"" in parentheses without over-explaining.

Weaknesses: Incomplete translation - omits the entire paragraph about Mr. Carter wiping sweat and his appearance, which represents a significant portion of the original text. This makes it an inadequate translation despite the quality of what is included.

**Ranking Analysis:**
Model 3 cannot be ranked highest due to the incomplete translation. Between Models 1 and 2, Model 2 maintains better accuracy to the original meaning despite the parenthetical additions. Model 1's meaning change regarding Sam's behavior is a more significant issue than Model 2's over-explanation.

Strengths: Retains the complete location information ""Berlin, Germany."" Includes helpful parenthetical explanation of ""city council."" Maintains the contrast structure ""Instead of shooting them"" from the original. Uses ""too cruel"" which effectively conveys the intensity.

Weaknesses: The explanation ""(the group that makes decisions for the city)"" is somewhat basic and could be more precise about local government structure.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides two parenthetical explanations that aid comprehension. The phrase ""wait and see"" is more natural than simple ""see."" Includes both ""illegal"" and its explanation ""against the law.""

Weaknesses: Contains redundant explanations that may interrupt reading flow. The double explanation for ""milder (warmer)"" is unnecessary since ""warmer"" already appears in the original context. The phrase ""local officials"" is less precise than ""group that makes decisions for the city.""

**Key Differences:**
Model 1 prioritizes brevity and flow but loses some contextual details. Model 2 balances simplification with information retention effectively. Model 3 provides the most explanatory support but risks over-explanation that could hinder natural reading progression.

All models successfully adapt the vocabulary and sentence complexity for B1 level while preserving the main narrative structure and causal relationships from the original text.

Strengths: Clear and concise language appropriate for B1 level. Uses simpler vocabulary (""ancient Greek myths"" instead of ""classical Greek mythology,"" ""controlled"" instead of ""ruled,"" ""maze"" instead of ""labyrinth""). Maintains all key information from the original text.

Weaknesses: Changes ""futuristic"" to ""modern,"" which alters the meaning since Katniss exists in a future dystopian world, not contemporary times.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful explanations in parentheses (""stories from ancient Greece,"" ""a huge maze"") which aids B1 comprehension. Preserves the future context by saying ""hero from the future."" Uses appropriate simplifications like ""old Greek myths"" and ""fight back.""

Weaknesses: Adds explanatory content not present in the original (""hero from the future""). The parenthetical explanations, while helpful, make the text longer and potentially interrupt reading flow.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides clear explanation of ""labyrinth"" in parentheses. Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary substitutions. Maintains the structure and flow of the original text well.

Weaknesses: Describes the labyrinth as ""underground passage"" which is inaccurate - labyrinths are not necessarily underground. Uses ""modern-day version"" instead of ""futuristic,"" losing the future time reference. Omits ""that lives there"" when describing the Minotaur's location.

**Ranking Analysis:**
Model 1 provides the cleanest translation with appropriate simplifications but loses the futuristic aspect. Model 2 offers the most comprehensive support for B1 learners with explanations and maintains the future context, though it adds content. Model 3 has factual inaccuracies and meaning changes that affect comprehension.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level. Maintains all key information from the original text. Sentence structure is straightforward and accessible.

Weaknesses: Loses some nuance by omitting ""the potential to"" from the first sentence. ""Homes"" is less precise than ""habitats."" The simplification may be slightly too basic for B1 level.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful explanations in parentheses for potentially difficult terms like ""conservation"" and ""animal behaviour."" Maintains the original meaning while making it accessible. Good balance between simplification and preserving important vocabulary.

Weaknesses: The parenthetical explanations may interrupt reading flow. Some B1 learners might not need these explanations, making the text appear condescending.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses ""visitors"" which is more specific and appropriate than generic ""people"" or ""us."" Maintains clear, simple language while preserving the original meaning. Good word choices like ""treated badly"" and ""studies"" are accessible yet precise.

Weaknesses: ""How animals act"" is more informal than ""animal behavior/behaviour."" Slightly less detailed than the other versions in explaining complex concepts.

Strengths: Maintains clear, simple language appropriate for B1 level. The sentence structure is straightforward and accessible. Successfully simplifies ""complain about the high cost"" to ""say that...costs a lot.""

Weaknesses: Changes verb tense from ""have been stopped"" to ""are stopped,"" altering the meaning from past experience to present routine. Omits ""many"" before ""city councils,"" reducing the scope indicated in the original.

Strengths: Adds helpful parenthetical explanation of ""hero's journey"" concept. Uses accessible vocabulary and maintains clear sentence structure. Provides context that aids B1 comprehension.

Weaknesses: The explanation interrupts the flow of the first sentence. Some redundancy in explaining the same concept twice within the text.

**Model 3 Feedback:**
Strengths: Provides comprehensive explanations of key concepts through integrated definitions and a detailed explanatory note at the end. Uses varied vocabulary while maintaining B1 accessibility. The final parenthetical explanation clearly defines both ""hero's journey"" and ""call to adventure.""

Weaknesses: Significantly longer than the original text, which may overwhelm B1 readers. The extensive additions change the text's focus from example to explanation. Some phrases like ""story structure"" might still be challenging for B1 level.

**Analysis:**
Model 1 offers the most faithful translation with appropriate simplification but lacks context. Model 2 provides helpful explanation while maintaining reasonable length. Model 3 offers the most comprehensive support for B1 learners but becomes quite lengthy and shifts the text's primary purpose.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for B1 level (""big asteroid,"" ""push it off its path""). Maintains the key information while simplifying complex terms. The sentence structure is clear and accessible.

Weaknesses: Changes ""PHA"" to ""big asteroid"" without explanation, potentially losing the technical specificity. The phrase ""try to explode it"" is less precise than the original ""blow it up.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Preserves the full acronym and explanation of HAMMER. Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary while maintaining technical accuracy. The flow between sentences is smooth and logical.

Weaknesses: Uses ""shot at"" instead of more precise alternatives like ""launched at"" or ""fired at."" The term ""destroy"" may be slightly less specific than ""blow up"" in this context.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes helpful explanation of ""hypervelocity"" which aids B1 comprehension. Uses ""break the asteroid apart"" which clearly explains the destruction process. Maintains technical accuracy while adding clarification.

Weaknesses: The added explanation of ""hypervelocity"" interrupts the text flow. ""Movie scene"" is less accurate than ""movie plot"" since the original refers to the film's subject matter, not a specific scene.

**Comparative Analysis:**
All three models successfully simplify the original text for B1 level. Model 1 uses the simplest language but sacrifices some technical precision. Model 2 balances simplification with accuracy effectively. Model 3 provides additional explanatory content but creates some flow issues and minor inaccuracies.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level. Maintains the core meaning while simplifying complex phrases. Good use of basic vocabulary and sentence structures.
Weaknesses: Loses some important details like ""but"" which shows the contrast in the hero's decision-making process. Removes quotation marks from key terms that emphasize important concepts. The phrase ""all inside the Death Star"" is less precise than the original ""inside the special world of the Death Star.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful explanations in parentheses for difficult concepts (""a wise guide,"" ""go into a new, unknown place""). Maintains quotation marks for key terms. Adds ""Luke Skywalker's story"" for clarity. Uses ""droids"" instead of ""robots"" which is more accurate to the source material.
Weaknesses: Slightly longer and more complex due to the explanatory additions. The phrase ""where the story happens"" changes the meaning from ""where the adventure happens.""

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the important contrast word ""but"" from the original. Provides explanatory parentheses for key concepts. Keeps quotation marks for important terms. Preserves the phrase ""special world of the Death Star"" more accurately than Model 1.
Weaknesses: Uses ""robots"" instead of the more accurate ""droids."" The explanatory parentheses, while helpful, add some complexity to the text.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for B1 level (""not used much,"" ""second-hand goods""). Maintains clear sentence structure and preserves the main ideas accurately. The flow is natural and easy to follow.

Weaknesses: Loses some precision by simplifying ""underutilised"" to ""not used much."" The phrase ""sharing directly with each other"" is somewhat vague compared to the original ""peer-to-peer sharing activities.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides additional context by adding a definition of the sharing economy at the end. Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary while maintaining accuracy. The phrase ""Since the internet appeared"" is a good simplification of ""advent of the internet.""

Weaknesses: The added definition, while helpful, goes beyond the original text's scope. Some word choices like ""unused things"" are less precise than ""underused assets"" in the original.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes helpful parenthetical explanations for difficult terms (""the advent means the beginning,"" ""second-hand (used),"" ""peer-to-peer means person-to-person""). These explanations directly support B1 learners' comprehension needs.

Weaknesses: The parenthetical explanations interrupt the text flow and make it less natural to read. The explanation of ""advent"" as simply ""beginning"" loses some nuance. The format becomes somewhat cluttered with the multiple explanations.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three models successfully simplify vocabulary and sentence structures for B1 level. Model 1 provides the cleanest, most natural-flowing translation. Model 2 adds useful context but extends beyond the original content. Model 3 prioritizes explicit vocabulary support but sacrifices readability.

Strengths: Maintains clear sentence structure and preserves the original meaning accurately. Uses appropriate B1-level vocabulary substitutions like ""out of style"" for ""out of fashion"" and ""low quality"" for ""poor quality.""

Weaknesses: Does not provide explanations for potentially challenging terms like ""fast fashion,"" ""recycle,"" or ""economic and environmental problems,"" which B1 learners might need. The phrase ""disposable-clothing problem"" remains unexplained.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides a clear definition of ""fast fashion"" in parentheses, making the concept accessible to B1 learners. Maintains the original structure while simplifying vocabulary appropriately. Uses ""large amounts"" instead of ""huge quantities"" for better comprehension.

Weaknesses: Does not explain ""recycle,"" ""economic,"" or ""environmental"" terms. The explanation of fast fashion, while helpful, is somewhat lengthy and could interrupt reading flow.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides comprehensive explanations for multiple challenging terms including ""fast fashion,"" ""recycled,"" ""economic,"" and ""environmental"" in parentheses. Uses clear, simple language throughout. The explanations are concise and directly helpful for B1 learners.

Weaknesses: The multiple parenthetical explanations may interrupt reading flow. Changes ""charity shops"" to ""charity"" in one instance, creating slight inconsistency with the original text's specific reference to shops.

**Ranking Analysis:**
Model 3 provides the most comprehensive support for B1 learners by explaining key vocabulary that might be challenging. Model 2 offers some explanation but less comprehensive coverage. Model 1 maintains clarity but provides no explanatory support for potentially difficult concepts.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear vocabulary appropriate for B1 level. Maintains the core narrative structure and all key information. The sentence ""Meagan McGrath from Canada loves big challenges"" effectively simplifies the opening while preserving meaning.

Weaknesses: Omits the opening generalization about adventurers, which changes the text's broader context. The phrase ""even though the weather was freezing and there were ice storms"" alters the original meaning by suggesting these were obstacles to overcome rather than conditions she endured throughout.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Preserves the original opening structure about adventurers in general. Includes helpful B1-level definitions in parentheses (glacier, sled). Maintains chronological flow and all factual details. Uses appropriate vocabulary simplification.

Weaknesses: The definition of glacier as ""a huge, slow-moving piece of ice"" includes unnecessary detail about movement that isn't relevant to the context. The phrase ""sled (a small cart)"" may be slightly inaccurate as sleds and carts function differently.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains the opening generalization effectively. Provides temperature conversion to Fahrenheit, helpful for B1 learners. Includes parenthetical definitions for technical terms. Maintains all key narrative elements and factual accuracy.

Weaknesses: Describes the sled as ""a heavy cart"" which may be misleading since the emphasis should be on what she was pulling rather than the cart's inherent weight. The glacier definition, while simpler than Model 2's, is adequate but basic.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three models successfully adapt the text to B1 level vocabulary and sentence structure. Model 2 and Model 3 better preserve the original text's complete meaning by retaining the opening context about adventurers in general. Model 1's narrative flow is smooth but loses some original content. Model 2 provides the most comprehensive explanations, while Model 3 offers practical additions like temperature conversion. Model 1 has the most natural flow but sacrifices completeness.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level. Maintains the core meaning while simplifying vocabulary (e.g., ""started out"" becomes ""began""). The sentence structure is straightforward and accessible.

Weaknesses: Omits ""home city"" context, losing some specificity. Changes ""encourage"" to ""consider,"" which slightly weakens the intended impact. Removes ""different"" before social issues, making the scope less clear.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Adds helpful clarification with ""problems that affect many people in society"" to explain social issues, which aids B1 comprehension. Uses ""hometown"" to maintain the personal connection to Paris. Includes ""notice and consider,"" which better captures the encouraging aspect.

Weaknesses: Adds ""images"" instead of ""pictures,"" though both are acceptable. The dash formatting may be less familiar to B1 learners than parentheses.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains ""different social issues"" from the original text. Uses parentheses for the explanatory phrase, which is a common format for definitions. Keeps ""hometown"" for context. Adds ""there"" for clarity about location.

Weaknesses: The parenthetical explanation interrupts the flow more than Model 2's approach. Uses ""the residents there"" which is slightly more complex than necessary.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three models successfully adapt the text to B1 level by simplifying vocabulary and sentence structure while preserving meaning. Model 2 provides the most helpful explanatory context without disrupting readability. Model 1 offers the cleanest simplification but loses some nuance. Model 3 maintains more original elements but with less smooth integration of explanatory material.

Strengths:
- Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level
- Maintains the core message of the original text
- Sentence structure is straightforward and easy to follow
- Vocabulary is accessible without being overly simplified

Weaknesses:
- Changes the meaning from ""encourage artists not to paint randomly"" to ""stop artists from painting randomly"" - this is a significant semantic shift
- Omits the explanatory phrase about councils providing alternatives
- Loses some nuance about the encouraging vs. prohibiting approach

**Model 2 Analysis:**

Strengths:
- Includes helpful clarification ""(the local government)"" for B1 learners
- Clearly explains the method councils use (""by giving artists special places"")
- Maintains appropriate vocabulary level
- Preserves the complete meaning about providing alternatives

Weaknesses:
- Also changes ""encourage not to"" into ""stop"" which alters the original meaning
- Uses ""putting graffiti"" instead of ""painting graffiti"" which is less precise
- The phrase ""anywhere"" is less specific than ""randomly on walls""

**Model 3 Analysis:**

Strengths:
- Includes the helpful clarification ""(the local government)""
- Clearly explains the council's method with ""by giving artists special areas""
- Uses ""freely paint"" which captures the spirit of the original
- Maintains good sentence flow with semicolon usage
- Preserves the meaning about providing designated spaces

Weaknesses:
- Changes the core meaning from ""encourage not to"" to ""stop"" 
- ""anywhere on walls"" is slightly awkward phrasing
- The semicolon might be slightly advanced for B1 level, though still appropriate

All three models share the critical flaw of misrepresenting the original approach from encouragement-based to prohibition-based. However, Models 2 and 3 better explain the alternative provision aspect, while Model 3 maintains the best overall flow and meaning preservation despite the semantic shift.

Strengths: Maintains the technical terminology ""high power distance"" and ""low power distance"" while keeping the language accessible. Preserves the original structure and meaning accurately. Uses appropriate B1-level vocabulary like ""questioned"" and ""welcoming challenges.""

Weaknesses: The hyphenation in ""low‑power‑distance"" is inconsistent with how ""high power distance"" is written. Some phrases like ""welcoming challenges"" might be slightly advanced for B1 level.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Effectively explains the concept by adding clarifying phrases like ""This means people respect authority a lot"" and ""This means workers often cooperate."" Uses quotation marks around ""power distance"" to signal it as a special term. The explanatory approach helps B1 learners understand the concept better.

Weaknesses: The added explanations make the text longer than necessary. The colon usage in ""like coaches or mentors: they encourage"" may be slightly complex for B1 level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Completely avoids the technical term ""power distance"" and replaces it with more accessible concepts like ""hierarchy was strong"" and ""hierarchy is much flatter."" Uses very clear, concrete language that B1 learners can easily understand. The phrase ""big differences in power"" effectively explains the concept without jargon.

Weaknesses: Loses the specific cultural terminology that might be important for learners to know. Changes ""previous work environment"" to ""company,"" which is less precise. The omission of technical terms means learners won't learn this specialized vocabulary.

Strengths: Maintains clear, simple language appropriate for B1 level. Successfully preserves the main narrative flow and key concepts. Uses accessible vocabulary like ""noticed"" and ""started an open talk.""

Weaknesses: Loses some specificity from the original, such as ""took the initiative"" becoming simply ""started."" The phrase ""precise instructions"" doesn't fully capture the original meaning of being told exactly what to do.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides clear explanation of cultural differences with ""came from different cultures."" Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary while maintaining meaning. The phrase ""felt hurt"" effectively simplifies ""took it personally."" Maintains consistent past tense throughout.

Weaknesses: ""Detailed instructions"" slightly shifts the meaning from the original context. Some minor loss of nuance in the overall tone.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes helpful clarification with ""(initiative)"" to aid B1 learners. Clearly explains the cultural context. Uses simple, direct language that matches the target level.

Weaknesses: Contains inconsistent verb tenses, mixing past tense (""saw,"" ""started"") with present tense (""feel,"" ""are not used,"" ""like,"" ""is""). This creates grammatical confusion. The parenthetical explanation, while helpful, disrupts the flow of the text.

**Ranking Analysis:**
Model 2 provides the most accurate and grammatically consistent translation while maintaining appropriate B1 level language. Model 1 offers good simplification but with some meaning loss.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level. Maintains the essential information while simplifying complex terms. The sentence structure is straightforward and accessible.

Weaknesses: Loses some technical precision by omitting ""mission"" and changing ""Earth-based telescopes"" to just ""Earth telescopes."" The phrase ""goes around"" is very informal compared to the original's ""orbiting.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Adds helpful clarification with the parenthetical explanation of what DART does. Maintains technical accuracy while using B1-appropriate vocabulary. Preserves ""Earth-based telescopes"" and uses ""circles"" as a good B1 alternative to ""orbiting.""

Weaknesses: The phrase ""let DART hit"" sounds somewhat awkward and less precise than ""test DART on."" The parenthetical explanation, while helpful, makes the first sentence quite long for B1 level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides dual vocabulary options with ""circles (or orbits)"" which is pedagogically useful for B1 learners. Maintains the ""mother"" metaphor from the original. Uses ""push"" which clearly conveys the physical action. Explicitly mentions ""the change"" which clarifies what telescopes will observe.

Weaknesses: The dual vocabulary approach, while educational, makes the text slightly more complex. Some might argue this deviates from pure simplification goals.

**Ranking:**
[""model_2"", ""model_3"", ""model_1""]

Model 2 ranks first for maintaining technical accuracy while providing helpful context. Model 3 follows closely with its educational approach and clear explanations. Model 1, while simple, loses some important nuances and uses overly informal language."

The other tribute from District 12 is a boy named Peeta, and Katniss soon finds herself in a complicated relationship with him.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simpler vocabulary consistently (""very good"" instead of ""skilful,"" ""take her place"" instead of ""go instead""). Maintains clear sentence structure and all essential information from the original.
Weaknesses: Does not provide explanation for the potentially unfamiliar term ""tribute,"" which may be challenging for B1 learners. Uses ""woods"" which could be simplified further.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Simplifies vocabulary effectively (""get food"" instead of ""provide food,"" ""forest"" instead of ""woods""). Provides helpful clarification of ""tribute"" with a parenthetical explanation. Uses ""difficult"" which is more accessible than ""complicated.""
Weaknesses: The explanation of tribute as ""forced to take part"" may not fully capture the voluntary aspect that becomes relevant when Katniss volunteers.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simplified vocabulary (""get food,"" ""forest""). Provides clarification of ""tribute"" with parenthetical explanation. Maintains the word ""complicated"" from the original text.
Weaknesses: The explanation ""selected to take part"" is somewhat vague and doesn't clearly convey the involuntary nature of being chosen. Retains ""complicated"" which is less accessible than ""difficult"" for B1 level.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three models successfully maintain the core narrative and use appropriate sentence structures for B1 level. The main differences lie in vocabulary choices and whether explanatory context is provided for potentially unfamiliar terms. Models 2 and 3 address the comprehension challenge of ""tribute"" while Model 1 does not. Model 2 uses the most consistently accessible vocabulary throughout.

Then you can start to connect your dreams with the events and feelings in your daily life.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple sentence structures appropriate for B1 level. The conditional ""If you write"" makes the instruction clear. Uses ""link"" as a simpler alternative to ""connect.""
Weaknesses: Changes ""place"" to singular when the original uses ""place"" (which can be singular), but loses some nuance. The phrase ""help you understand it"" is less specific than the original's reference to meaning.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains good B1-level vocabulary while preserving most original meaning. Correctly uses ""places"" (plural) and explicitly mentions ""meaning."" The phrase ""begin to connect"" closely matches the original's ""start connecting.""
Weaknesses: Retains ""When you write"" structure which is slightly more complex than necessary. Uses ""with"" instead of ""to"" when connecting dreams to daily life, which changes the preposition from the original.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Simplifies the opening with ""Writing about your dreams helps"" which is very clear for B1 learners. Adds helpful clarification ""(the idea behind the dream)"" to explain ""meaning."" Uses ""places"" correctly and maintains the connection concept.
Weaknesses: The parenthetical explanation, while helpful, adds complexity that wasn't in the original. Changes ""you will be surprised"" to ""you'll be surprised,"" which is more informal. Also uses ""with"" instead of ""to"" for the preposition.

All three models successfully adapt the text to B1 level by using simpler vocabulary and shorter sentences. They maintain the core message about dream journaling and analysis.

This was especially true for old train bridges, where the steel wheels and tracks could make sparks that sometimes caused the wooden bridge to burn down.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for B1 level, maintains clear sentence structure, and preserves the main meaning. The phrase ""burn down"" effectively conveys the complete destruction.

Weaknesses: Loses the word ""historically"" from the original, and ""make it burn down"" is slightly redundant after ""set the bridge on fire.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful clarification by defining steel as ""strong metal"" which aids B1 comprehension. Uses simple vocabulary and clear sentence structure. Breaks complex ideas into shorter, more digestible sentences.

Weaknesses: Changes ""many"" to ""most"" which alters the original meaning. The parenthetical explanation, while helpful, interrupts sentence flow. The phrasing ""make it burn down"" creates redundancy.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains concise language while preserving the original meaning accurately. Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary and avoids redundancy by ending with ""burn down"" rather than repeating the fire concept. The relative clause structure is clear and appropriate for the level.

Weaknesses: Could potentially benefit from slightly simpler sentence construction, though the current structure remains accessible for B1 learners.

All three translations successfully adapt the text to B1 level by simplifying ""susceptible to fire"" to ""could catch fire easily"" and using accessible vocabulary. Model 3 provides the most accurate and concise translation while maintaining clarity. Model 1 offers good simplification but has minor redundancy issues. Model 2 provides helpful clarification but alters the original meaning and has flow interruptions.

Strengths: Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary and sentence structures. The phrase ""clear trends"" effectively simplifies ""certain trends are emerging."" Maintains good flow and readability. Successfully preserves all key information from the original.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""real, important art form"" adds an adjective (""important"") not present in the original. Could have simplified ""predict exactly"" further for B1 level.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful clarifications like ""(people who work with art)"" and ""(legitimate)"" which aid B1 comprehension. Uses ""patterns"" instead of ""trends"" which may be easier vocabulary. Maintains formal tone while simplifying language.

Weaknesses: The parenthetical explanations, while helpful, make the text longer and potentially interrupt reading flow. The phrase ""will stay with us"" changes the original meaning slightly from ""here to stay.""

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very clear, simple sentence structures appropriate for B1. The explanation ""(the people who work with and study art)"" is comprehensive. Vocabulary choices like ""patterns"" are accessible.

Weaknesses: Loses some information by omitting ""around the globe/different countries"" and simply stating ""other countries."" The ending ""will stay"" is less emphatic than the original ""here to stay."" Some sentences feel overly simplified, potentially losing nuance.

Strengths: Uses simpler vocabulary (""scary"" instead of ""frightening"", ""war news on TV"" instead of ""news programmes of wars""). The sentence structure is clear and accessible.
Weaknesses: Changes the present perfect tense to simple present (""always finds"" instead of ""has always found""), which alters the meaning slightly. Removes ""programmes"" entirely, which may oversimplify the original meaning.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the original grammatical structure and tense usage accurately. Provides helpful explanations in parentheses for potentially difficult terms (pilot, US Air Force, Vietnam War context).
Weaknesses: The added explanations may be unnecessary for B1 level learners and make the text longer. Keeps ""programmes"" spelling and ""frightening"" which might be challenging vocabulary for B1 level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Expands ""upset"" into a clearer phrase ""felt upset when she watches,"" making the emotion more explicit. Adds ""Vietnam War"" for clarity. Uses simpler vocabulary (""scary"" instead of ""frightening"").
Weaknesses: Creates a tense inconsistency by mixing ""has always felt upset"" with ""watches"" (present tense). Changes ""not telling her what was happening"" to ""not talking about,"" which slightly alters the meaning.

**Overall Assessment:**
Model 1 provides the most consistent simplification while maintaining readability. Model 2 preserves the original structure most faithfully but may be too complex for B1 level. Model 3 makes good vocabulary choices but introduces grammatical inconsistencies.

Strengths: Maintains the original sentence structure well, uses appropriate B1 vocabulary, preserves the meaning accurately with ""multi-adventurer"" simplified to ""adventurer who does many activities.""
Weaknesses: ""Across the deserts"" changes the original meaning from ""through the deserts,"" and ""kayaked in"" loses the movement aspect of ""through"" the Grand Canyon.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simpler sentence structures appropriate for B1 level, adds helpful clarification ""(the highest mountain in the world)"" for Everest, maintains clear meaning throughout, uses ""paddled a kayak"" which is more explicit than just ""kayaked.""
Weaknesses: ""He loves many kinds of adventure"" is an interpretation rather than a direct translation of ""multi-adventurer,"" and breaks the original into more sentences than necessary.

Strengths: Maintains natural flow and readability. Uses appropriate B1-level vocabulary substitutions like ""got home"" instead of ""arrived home"" and ""favourite"" for ""beloved."" Preserves the original meaning accurately while simplifying complex structures.

Weaknesses: Retains ""filled up with"" as ""would fill with,"" which could still be challenging for B1 learners. The phrase structure remains relatively complex in some areas.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful clarification by defining jazz as ""a kind of music,"" which is valuable for B1 learners. Uses clear, simple vocabulary throughout. Adds ""decided to"" which makes the intention more explicit. Uses ""carried"" which is more concrete than ""took.""

Weaknesses: Includes unnecessary parenthetical explanation that interrupts reading flow. The addition of ""also"" changes the original emphasis slightly.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very simple, direct language appropriate for B1 level. Simplifies ""took it up to"" to just ""went to."" Provides the jazz explanation in parentheses. Uses American spelling ""favorite"" consistently.

Weaknesses: Loses some detail by omitting ""some"" before homework and ""himself"" from the coffee-making action. The parenthetical explanation interrupts flow. Removes ""dinner"" from the final cooking reference, making it less specific.

**Overall Assessment:**
Model 1 maintains the best balance between simplification and preserving the original text's natural flow and completeness. Model 2 provides helpful clarification but with some awkward additions. Model 3 oversimplifies and loses some original meaning while maintaining good B1-level accessibility.

Strengths: Maintains accurate technical information, preserves the original structure well, and uses appropriate B1-level vocabulary. The translation is clear and direct.
Weaknesses: Retains some complex phrasing like ""come within 50 million kilometres of Earth's orbit"" that may challenge B1 readers. The sentence structure could be simplified further.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Simplifies ""planetary defence team"" to ""team that protects the planet,"" making it more accessible. Uses clearer language like ""big asteroids"" and ""come close to Earth."" Good sentence flow for B1 level.
Weaknesses: Changes ""rocks"" to ""asteroids"" inconsistently, and ""travel within"" is less precise than the original meaning. Some technical concepts remain challenging.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful explanations in parentheses like ""(the group that watches space for dangerous rocks)"" which aids B1 comprehension. Consistently uses ""rocks"" throughout, creating better cohesion. Breaks down complex concepts effectively.
Weaknesses: The parenthetical explanations, while helpful, make some sentences longer and potentially more complex. The added explanatory text sometimes disrupts reading flow.

All three models successfully convey the factual content and maintain accuracy regarding the numbers and scientific information. They appropriately simplify ""identified and logged"" to ""found and recorded"" and make the technical content more accessible.

Model 2 achieves the best balance between simplification and clarity for B1 readers, while Model 3's explanatory approach is helpful but sometimes creates additional complexity. Model 1, though accurate, retains more challenging language structures.

Strengths: Maintains clear, simple sentence structure appropriate for B1 level. Successfully simplifies ""agonising"" to ""very hard"" and ""intense"" to ""strong."" Uses accessible vocabulary throughout.

Weaknesses: Loses the phrase ""behind their hands"" which is important contextual detail. Changes ""talking about him behind their hands"" to ""talking about him quietly,"" which alters the specific imagery. The transition ""During the school year"" is less smooth than the original's flow.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Preserves the original phrase ""behind their hands"" which maintains the specific context. Adds helpful clarification by explaining ""the plague"" as ""a serious disease that they think he might have,"" which aids B1 comprehension. Uses clear paragraph breaks that improve readability.

Weaknesses: The explanation of ""the plague"" may be overly explicit and changes the meaning slightly - in the original context, it's likely a cruel nickname rather than an actual disease concern. The addition of explanatory text makes it longer than necessary for B1 level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Effectively uses parenthetical explanations like ""(very uncomfortable)"" and ""(a disease)"" to clarify difficult terms while maintaining the original text structure. Preserves ""behind their hands"" and keeps ""traumatic"" with explanation rather than removing it entirely.

Weaknesses: The parenthetical format may appear awkward and interrupt reading flow. Some explanations are redundant - ""painful (very uncomfortable)"" uses two similar concepts. The approach feels more like a learning exercise than a natural B1 translation.

**Overall Assessment:**
Model 1 provides the smoothest reading experience but loses some specific details. Model 2 maintains important details and adds helpful context but may over-explain. Model 3 attempts to preserve original vocabulary with explanations but creates a choppy reading experience.

This is not a translation at all. The model appears to have misunderstood the task completely and provided a generic greeting response instead of translating the text to B1 level.

**Model 2 Feedback:**
Strengths: Successfully simplifies complex vocabulary (e.g., ""property"" becomes ""land""), maintains the narrative flow, includes helpful parenthetical explanation for ""hooves,"" and preserves all key story elements. The sentence structures are appropriately simplified for B1 level while remaining natural.

Weaknesses: Minor grammatical error in the final sentence (""could get even more trouble"" should be ""could get into even more trouble""), and some word choices could be more precise.

**Model 3 Feedback:**
Strengths: Provides clear explanations in parentheses for potentially difficult concepts (""rebellious"" and its meaning), uses appropriate B1-level vocabulary, maintains good narrative coherence, and includes direct speech which can aid comprehension. The translation preserves the original meaning effectively.

Weaknesses: The direct speech format (""Can the boy ride it?"") changes the original indirect question structure, which slightly alters the narrative style. Some explanations might be unnecessary for B1 level learners.

**Overall Assessment:**
Model 1 fails to complete the task. Both Model 2 and Model 3 demonstrate understanding of B1 level requirements by simplifying vocabulary, shortening sentences, and adding explanatory elements. Model 2 maintains closer fidelity to the original structure while Model 3 takes more liberties with formatting but provides clearer explanations.

Strengths: Maintains accurate terminology by keeping ""climbers,"" uses appropriate B1 vocabulary substitutions (""cold weather"" for ""freezing conditions,"" ""strong storms"" for ""violent storms""), preserves the original meaning well, and maintains natural sentence flow.

Weaknesses: Minor structural change from ""as a teenager"" to ""when she was a teenager"" adds unnecessary words, and ""After she left school"" is slightly more complex than needed for B1.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Good vocabulary simplification with appropriate B1 alternatives, maintains original sentence structure in most places, preserves ""as a teenager"" from the original, and uses ""Even though"" to maintain the contrast effectively.

Weaknesses: Changes ""climbers"" to ""people"" which loses some specificity about who accomplished this feat, though this change does make it more accessible for B1 learners.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Adds ""Mount"" before Everest for clarity, uses ""very risky"" as an accessible alternative to ""extremely dangerous,"" and provides helpful clarification with ""whenever she had free time.""

Weaknesses: Changes ""climbers"" to ""people"" losing specificity, adds unnecessary parenthetical explanation ""(climbing big hills)"" which oversimplifies mountain climbing, uses repetitive ""very"" twice in one sentence, includes redundant relative clause ""who is from Austria,"" and ""finished school"" is less natural than the original phrasing.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""move around their area"" is somewhat vague compared to the original's ""get from one part of their territory to another."" The transition ""Either way"" might be challenging for B1 learners.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful explanations in parentheses (""a pack,"" ""the metro,"" ""underground train system"") which aids B1 comprehension. Breaks down complex sentences into shorter, more digestible parts. Adds clarifying phrase ""and then they share it with the whole pack"" which makes the concept clearer.

Weaknesses: Slightly longer than necessary for B1 level due to the explanatory additions. The phrase ""ride without being noticed by most locals"" changes the meaning slightly from the original.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses clear, simple language throughout. Provides helpful clarification with ""metro (the underground train)"" without being overly verbose. Maintains good sentence flow while simplifying vocabulary appropriately.

Weaknesses: Loses the specific detail about dogs being ""sent"" to beg, which changes the meaning slightly. The dash usage in ""very good sense of smell – they can recognise"" may be confusing for B1 learners who typically work with simpler punctuation.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three models successfully adapt the text for B1 level by simplifying vocabulary and sentence structures. Model 1 stays closest to the original meaning while maintaining simplicity. Model 2 provides the most comprehensive explanations but becomes somewhat verbose. Model 3 offers good balance but has minor meaning shifts and punctuation issues.

Strengths: Maintains clear, simple sentence structure appropriate for B1 level. Successfully simplifies ""destruction"" to ""damage"" and ""environmental"" to ""nature."" Preserves the main meaning while using accessible vocabulary.

Weaknesses: ""showed him the hardest paths"" changes the meaning from ""guide him through"" difficult terrain, suggesting he was shown paths rather than guided through areas. ""speak against"" is less precise than ""protest about.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful explanations in parentheses for ""radio"" and ""blog,"" which supports B1 learners. Uses clear, concrete language like ""cutting down"" instead of ""destruction."" Maintains all key information from the original.

Weaknesses: The parenthetical explanations may be overly simplistic for B1 level, as these terms are commonly known. The radio explanation is particularly basic since radios are familiar technology.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Balances simplification with maintaining appropriate B1 vocabulary level. Uses ""speak out against"" which is more precise than Model 1's ""speak against."" Provides a useful explanation for ""charities"" which is contextually appropriate.

Weaknesses: ""news attention"" is slightly less natural than ""media interest,"" though still comprehensible. The charity explanation, while helpful, may not be necessary for B1 level.

Strengths: Maintains clear sentence structure and preserves all key information from the original. Uses appropriate B1-level vocabulary replacements like ""realized"" for ""caught on"" and ""rent out"" for ""let them out."" The flow between sentences is natural and coherent.

Weaknesses: Loses some specificity by omitting ""lucrative accommodation"" and ""unused rooms and houses"" becomes just ""empty rooms or houses,"" which slightly changes the meaning.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful clarification with ""(they link two sides)"" to explain the middleman concept, which aids B1 comprehension. Maintains the concept of ""underutilised resources"" with ""resources that are not being used much."" Preserves the accommodation context clearly.

Weaknesses: The parenthetical explanation, while helpful, disrupts sentence flow. The phrase ""resources that are not being used much"" is somewhat awkward. Some sentences become longer and more complex than ideal for B1 level.

Strengths: Maintains clear structure and flow. Uses appropriate B1-level vocabulary substitutions like ""main jobs"" for ""functions"" and ""have babies"" for ""breeding."" Preserves all key information accurately. The sentence structure remains natural and readable.

Weaknesses: Retains the complex term ""genetic diversity"" without explanation, which may be challenging for B1 learners.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful clarification by explaining genetic similarity with ""they have less variety in their DNA."" Uses accessible vocabulary like ""partners"" and ""homes."" Maintains good readability while preserving technical accuracy.

Weaknesses: The parenthetical explanation, while helpful, creates a longer sentence that may be more complex for B1 level. Some sentences could be shorter for better comprehension.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides the most comprehensive explanations with parenthetical clarifications for ""endangered,"" ""hunters,"" and genetic concepts. Uses very accessible language like ""set free"" instead of ""released."" Shows strong awareness of B1 vocabulary limitations.

Weaknesses: The frequent parenthetical explanations make sentences significantly longer and more complex, potentially overwhelming for B1 learners. Some explanations are redundant (explaining both ""genetic similarity"" and ""genetic diversity"" separately). The text becomes dense with multiple clarifications in single sentences.

**Overall Assessment:**
Model 1 provides the cleanest adaptation with good vocabulary simplification. Model 2 offers a balanced approach with selective explanations. Model 3 shows thorough consideration of vocabulary challenges but over-explains, creating complexity that may hinder comprehension at B1 level.

Strengths: Maintains clear narrative flow and uses appropriate B1-level vocabulary substitutions (""very scared"" for ""terrified,"" ""sea"" for ""ocean""). The sentence structure remains accessible while preserving the original meaning.

Weaknesses: Changes ""remembers"" to ""thinks about,"" which slightly alters the meaning. Uses ""does not want to eat him right away"" which implies intention rather than lack of interest.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Preserves the verb ""remembers"" from the original text. Includes helpful clarification with ""(sick because of the boat's motion)"" to explain ""seasick"" for B1 learners. Uses proper punctuation with dashes around the tiger's name.

Weaknesses: The added explanation, while educational, makes the text longer and potentially interrupts reading flow. ""Does not want to eat him right now"" still implies intentional choice rather than disinterest.

Weaknesses: Loses some precision by changing ""Pi's family"" to just ""Pi's family"" in the drowning scene, though this is minor. The phrase ""manages to get into"" adds interpretation not present in the original.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful vocabulary support by including original terms in parentheses (emigrate, lifeboat). Uses ""sadly"" as an appropriate B1-level replacement for ""tragically."" Maintains most of the original meaning while simplifying language.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""stays alive in a small boat"" changes the meaning slightly - the original suggests Pi found himself there, not that he actively stayed alive there. Some redundancy with ""Pi's parents"" instead of ""Pi's family.""

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides the most comprehensive vocabulary support with explanatory phrases in parentheses. The explanation ""(go to live in another country)"" clearly defines emigration. Includes helpful definition of ""orang-utan"" which aids comprehension. Uses bold formatting to highlight explained terms.

Weaknesses: The explanations, while helpful, make the text longer and potentially interrupt reading flow. The phrase ""ends up in"" is appropriate but changes the tone slightly from the original ""finds himself.""

Strengths: Includes helpful clarification by explaining ""digital copies (electronic versions you can read on a computer or tablet)"" which aids B1 comprehension. Maintains all essential information while using simpler vocabulary like ""teens"" instead of ""teenagers.""

Weaknesses: The parenthetical explanation, while helpful, makes one sentence longer and potentially more complex for the target level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides the most comprehensive explanation of electronic copies as ""e-books – digital books you can read on a computer or tablet."" Uses shorter, simpler sentences by breaking up complex information. Maintains all original content accurately.

Weaknesses: The formatting with the dash and parentheses creates visual complexity. Some sentences are very short, which might seem choppy.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three models successfully adapt the text to B1 level by simplifying vocabulary and maintaining readability. Model 1 provides the most natural flow but lacks explanatory support. Model 2 offers a good balance of simplification and clarification. Model 3 provides the most thorough explanations for B1 learners but with some formatting issues.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear vocabulary appropriate for B1 level. Maintains the original meaning accurately. Sentence structure is straightforward and easy to follow.
Weaknesses: Does not provide clarification for potentially difficult concepts like ""symbols."" The phrase ""handles language"" and ""handles emotions"" is somewhat informal but acceptable.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes helpful clarification by defining symbols as ""pictures that stand for ideas."" Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary. Maintains accuracy to the original text. Good balance between simplification and clarity.
Weaknesses: The definition of symbols as ""pictures"" may be slightly misleading since dream symbols aren't necessarily visual images.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and sentence structures appropriate for B1 level. Maintains the core message about relationships and happiness. The term ""self-disclosure"" is retained with quotation marks for clarity.

Weaknesses: ""One close talk"" is awkward phrasing that doesn't clearly convey the meaning of having one person for deep conversations. ""A group of other friends"" loses the concept of a broader network of relationships.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful clarification by explaining self-disclosure as ""talking openly about your inner thoughts."" Uses ""wider circle of other friends"" which better captures the network concept. The phrase ""deeper, more personal connection"" reinforces the main point effectively.

Weaknesses: Slightly more complex vocabulary in some instances. The explanation in parentheses, while helpful, adds length that might challenge B1 readers.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains the original phrase ""heart-to-heart talk"" which is accessible and meaningful. Provides a clear explanation of self-disclosure. Uses concrete examples like ""play games"" instead of the more abstract ""activities.""

Weaknesses: Changes ""do things with"" to ""play games,"" which narrows the original meaning and may not represent all social activities. The structure remains relatively complex in some sentences.

Strengths: Clear and accessible language appropriate for B1 level. Successfully simplifies complex concepts while maintaining the core message. Good flow and readability.
Weaknesses: Omits the concept of ""plasticity"" entirely, which is a key term from the original. The phrase ""what seems to be natural talent"" is slightly awkward compared to the original's ""seemingly innate talents.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains the important concept of brain plasticity with explanation in parentheses, making it accessible to B1 learners. Maintains good sentence structure and clarity. Includes the research context effectively.
Weaknesses: Minor inconsistency in the examples - changes ""organising events"" to ""planning events"" unnecessarily. The parenthetical explanation of plasticity, while helpful, slightly interrupts the flow.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Explains the plasticity concept clearly with ""this is called plasticity"" which is very B1-appropriate. Maintains the structure and meaning of the original well. Good balance between simplification and accuracy.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for B1 level (""looks at,"" ""does not last very long,"" ""making more of it again""). The sentence structure is straightforward and accessible. Successfully conveys the main scientific concepts in plain language.

Weaknesses: ""Looks at"" is less precise than ""analyses"" - the rover performs chemical analysis rather than visual observation. Uses ""tonnes"" (British spelling) while the original uses ""tons"" (American spelling), creating inconsistency.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful clarification by explaining that organic molecules contain carbon, which aids B1 comprehension. Uses ""discovered"" which maintains some of the scientific tone while remaining accessible.

Weaknesses: Contains a significant error - ""thousands of tons of at once"" is missing the word ""methane,"" making the sentence incomplete and confusing. This grammatical error impairs understanding.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains good sentence flow and readability. Uses ""must be"" which appropriately conveys the logical conclusion. Preserves the original ""tons"" spelling. The explanation ""basic building block of life"" provides useful context for B1 learners.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""basic building block of life"" may be misleading since the original text refers to methane as a ""basic organic molecule"" and ""key ingredient of natural gas,"" not specifically as a building block of life. This changes the scientific meaning.

**Overall Assessment:**
Model 1 provides the most accurate and complete translation with appropriate B1 simplification. Model 2 has a critical grammatical error that affects comprehension. Model 3 has good language level but introduces potentially misleading scientific information.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for B1 level (""bad person"" instead of ""psychopath,"" ""wet"" instead of ""damp""). The sentence structure is clear and accessible. Maintains the core meaning while simplifying language.

Weaknesses: Loses some nuance by changing ""No matter what kind of house"" to ""In any house."" The simplification of ""evil psychopath"" to ""bad person"" removes important context about the severity of the character type.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful explanations in parentheses for difficult terms (""psychopath – someone who does very harmful things"" and ""damp (wet)""). Maintains more of the original phrasing with ""Whatever kind of house."" Preserves the meaning while adding clarification.

Weaknesses: The parenthetical explanations make sentences longer and potentially more complex for B1 readers. The explanation of psychopath could be clearer and more direct.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Balances simplification with accuracy by using ""dangerous person (a psychopath)"" which maintains the original term while making it accessible. Uses ""usually dark"" instead of ""always dark,"" which is more accurate to the original. Provides simple clarification with ""damp (wet).""

Weaknesses: Retains the more complex opening phrase ""No matter what kind of house"" which might be challenging for B1 level. The parenthetical additions slightly increase sentence complexity.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear vocabulary appropriate for B1 level. Successfully simplifies ""hit the nail on the head"" to ""said some very true things."" Maintains the main ideas and logical flow of the original text.

Weaknesses: Changes ""engages in a different conversation online"" to ""talks on their phone,"" which loses some meaning since online conversations aren't necessarily phone calls. The final sentence structure is slightly awkward.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides explicit explanation of the idiom ""hit the nail on the head"" in parentheses, which is helpful for B1 learners. Uses clear organizational markers (""First,"" ""Second"") that improve readability. Maintains all key concepts from the original.

Weaknesses: Retains the original idiom before explaining it, which may confuse B1 readers initially. The explanation method breaks the flow of the text. Some phrases like ""pointed out a common problem"" add complexity not present in the original.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Effectively paraphrases the idiom as ""said exactly the right things."" Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary throughout. Maintains the complete meaning of the original text, including the detail about ""different people online.""

Weaknesses: The phrase ""how parents affect their children"" is somewhat more formal than needed. Minor grammatical issue in the final sentence where ""talks on their phone or computer"" should be ""talk"" for plural agreement.

**Overall Assessment:**
Model 1 provides the clearest, most natural-sounding B1 translation but loses some specific meaning. Model 2 maintains accuracy but uses a potentially confusing explanation method. Model 3 balances simplification with meaning retention most effectively, despite minor grammatical issues.

Strengths: Maintains the original structure and flow well. Uses appropriate B1-level vocabulary while preserving most of the original meaning. The sentence structure is clear and accessible.

Weaknesses: Contains a minor error (""World II"" instead of ""World War II""). Does not provide explanations for potentially difficult terms like ""civil wars"" or ""civilians,"" which B1 learners might need.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful explanations in parentheses for key terms (World War II, civil wars, terrorism, civilians, political conflict). Uses clear, simple sentence structures. Breaks down complex information into digestible parts. Maintains accuracy throughout.

Weaknesses: The format with frequent line breaks and parenthetical explanations makes the text somewhat choppy and less natural to read. The explanations, while helpful, interrupt the flow of the text.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides some helpful explanations in parentheses for key terms. Maintains a more natural flow than Model 2 while still offering clarifications.

Strengths: Maintains clear, simple language appropriate for B1 level. Preserves the main narrative flow and key information. Uses accessible vocabulary while retaining the core message.

Weaknesses: Loses some nuance from the original, such as ""once too often"" and ""sitting up and taking notice."" The phrase ""doing the trick"" is simplified to ""working"" but loses the idiomatic expression's meaning. Some details about the humanitarian context are condensed.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful clarification by adding ""(mountaineering)"" after ""climbing mountains."" Maintains good sentence structure for B1 level. Preserves most key information while using simpler vocabulary. The colon usage before the final sentence works well.

Weaknesses: Uses ""aid projects"" and ""aid campaigns"" instead of maintaining ""humanitarian"" terminology, which slightly changes the context. The phrase ""must stand up"" is stronger than the original's ""needed to stand up.""

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Breaks complex sentences into shorter, more digestible segments appropriate for B1 learners. Provides excellent explanatory additions like ""(mountaineering)"" and ""(projects that help people in need)."" Uses clear paragraph breaks to organize information logically. Maintains all essential information while making it highly accessible.

Weaknesses: The additional explanations, while helpful, make the text longer than necessary. Some sentence breaks create a slightly choppy reading experience. The phrase ""beginning to work"" is less definitive than the original's sense of current success.

**Ranking:**

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level. Maintains good flow and readability. Successfully conveys all key statistical information accurately. The sentence structure is straightforward and accessible.

Weaknesses: Lacks explanatory support for potentially challenging vocabulary like ""dictators."" Some nuanced meaning from the original is lost, such as the emphasis on ""meaningful change"" and ""incredible poverty.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful parenthetical explanation for ""dictators,"" which aids B1 comprehension. Maintains the colon structure from the original text. Includes all statistical data accurately. Uses appropriate B1-level vocabulary throughout.

Weaknesses: The explanation of dictators, while helpful, is somewhat lengthy and could disrupt reading flow. The phrase ""have all the power and do not allow freedom"" may still be complex for some B1 learners.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides multiple parenthetical explanations for key terms (""developing,"" ""dictators,"" ""poverty""), which strongly supports B1 comprehension. Uses varied vocabulary like ""state"" instead of ""situation"" and ""illnesses"" instead of ""disease."" Maintains all essential information from the original.

Weaknesses: Contains multiple parenthetical explanations that may interrupt reading flow and make sentences feel choppy. The explanation ""being very poor"" for poverty may be redundant since the concept is likely familiar to B1 learners. Some explanations feel over-simplified.

Weaknesses: Loses the specific ""sandwich"" metaphor that helps explain the concept. The phrase ""covering up"" is somewhat less precise than the original concept of sugarcoating.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains and explains the ""sandwiching"" concept with a helpful clarification in parentheses. Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary while maintaining precision. The term ""criticism"" effectively replaces ""negative feedback"" for variety.
Weaknesses: Slightly longer sentences that approach the upper limit of B1 complexity. The parenthetical explanation adds length to an already complex sentence.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very simple vocabulary and short sentences suitable for B1 learners. Replaces ""employees"" with ""workers"" and ""performance"" with ""work"" for simpler terms.
Weaknesses: Oversimplifies the opening concept by saying ""add positive words"" instead of explaining the sandwich structure. Loses the specific technique being described. The phrase ""covering up the bad news"" changes the meaning from feedback to news delivery.

Strengths: Maintains clear structure and preserves the main message effectively. Uses appropriate B1-level vocabulary with successful simplifications like ""scary movie picture"" for ""movie image"" and ""wrong"" for ""unethical."" The flow remains natural and coherent.

Weaknesses: ""Self-controlled"" may be less familiar to B1 learners than ""autonomous."" The phrase ""stamping on human skulls"" is simplified to just mentioning ""Terminator"" but loses some specificity about the violent imagery.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful clarification by adding ""(able to act on its own)"" after ""autonomous,"" which aids B1 comprehension. Maintains good sentence flow and uses accessible vocabulary. The Terminator reference is clearly explained as ""steps on people's heads.""

Weaknesses: Changes ""will be"" to ""could be,"" which alters the certainty expressed in the original text. The phrase ""Don't think only of"" adds a word (""only"") not present in the original meaning.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Offers the most comprehensive support for B1 learners by defining ""autonomous"" in a separate sentence and explaining ""unethical"" in parentheses. Uses clear paragraph breaks that enhance readability. Provides explicit definitions that aid understanding.

Weaknesses: The formatting with multiple short paragraphs changes the original structure significantly. Some explanatory additions make the text longer and potentially interrupt the flow. The phrase ""extremely careful"" is stronger than the original ""very cautious indeed.""

Strengths: Maintains the original meaning accurately while using simpler vocabulary. ""All the other languages together"" is clearer than ""combined."" Uses appropriate B1-level phrases like ""there isn't much connection"" and ""clearer link.""
Weaknesses: Removes the emphasis ""by far"" when describing Chinese native speakers, which slightly weakens the comparison. The phrase ""Chinese still has"" adds an unnecessary word not present in the original.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very accessible vocabulary with ""study"" instead of ""learning"" and ""biggest number"" instead of complex terms. The explanation ""people who speak it as their first language"" effectively clarifies ""native speakers"" for B1 learners.
Weaknesses: Changes ""However"" to ""But,"" which is less formal. Uses ""not a strong link"" instead of ""little correlation,"" which changes the degree of emphasis from the original.

Weaknesses: Loses some emotional nuance by changing ""worry"" to ""think about,"" and ""criticism"" may be too advanced for B1 level compared to the original's more neutral tone.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the worry/anxiety element, uses appropriate B1 vocabulary, and provides the most comprehensive explanation of the feedback sandwich concept with clear structure.
Weaknesses: The explanation becomes somewhat lengthy and didactic, potentially disrupting the narrative flow. The phrase ""usual first compliment"" is slightly awkward.

During his trips, Lewis has seen this damage himself. He has swum over coral reefs that have turned white because the water is getting hotter, and he has seen empty, desert‑like areas in the shallow waters of the Red Sea, with no life and lots of plastic.  

Pugh believes nature can recover if we give it space, but time is running out. If we do not start caring for our seas, we may soon face a problem that is very hard to solve.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple, clear vocabulary appropriate for B1 level. Maintains the core message and structure of the original text. The phrase ""white because the water is hotter"" effectively simplifies ""bleached by the increase in water temperature.""

Weaknesses: The phrase ""empty underwater areas"" loses the specific imagery of ""underwater deserts."" Some nuance is lost in the simplification, such as changing ""unsolvable problem"" to ""problem we cannot solve,"" which is less impactful.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides good explanatory phrases like ""catching too many fish"" for overfishing and ""throwing trash into the sea"" for littering. Retains the ""underwater deserts"" metaphor with quotation marks, preserving the original imagery. Uses clear paragraph breaks for better readability.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""very hard to solve"" weakens the urgency compared to ""unsolvable problem."" The explanation ""throwing trash into the sea"" is more specific than the original ""littering,"" which can occur on land as well.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes helpful explanatory text ""special parts of the ocean that are kept safe"" for marine protected areas, which aids B1 comprehension. Maintains the ""desert-like areas"" imagery effectively. Preserves the conditional ""may soon face"" from the original text.

Weaknesses: The added explanation, while helpful, makes the text longer and potentially more complex for B1 readers. ""Too much fishing"" is less precise than ""overfishing"" and could be confusing.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three models successfully adapt the text to B1 level by simplifying vocabulary and sentence structures while maintaining the essential meaning. Model 2 provides the best balance of clarity and accuracy, with helpful explanations that don't overly complicate the text. Model 3 offers good explanatory content but adds unnecessary length. Model 1 provides the most concise version but loses some important imagery and impact.

Strengths: Concise and captures the main points effectively. Uses simple vocabulary and sentence structures appropriate for B1 level. The flow is natural and easy to follow.

Weaknesses: Omits some details from the original text, such as the specific mention of ""desperation"" and ""protagonists."" The phrase ""feels unrealistic"" could be simplified further. Lacks some explanatory elements that would help B1 learners.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes helpful parenthetical explanations like ""(the people the story follows)"" which aids B1 comprehension. Maintains most of the original content while using accessible language. Good balance between completeness and simplicity.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""most people have mobile phones"" slightly changes the original meaning. Some sentences could be broken down further for easier processing at B1 level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides the most comprehensive explanations with phrases like ""(the people the story follows)"" and ""that means the phone has no signal."" Uses bold formatting to highlight key terms. Maintains the original meaning while making it accessible.

Weaknesses: Slightly longer and more complex than necessary for B1 level. The explanation ""that means the phone has no signal"" may be redundant since ""no phone coverage"" is already simplified language. The formatting with bold text may not be necessary for comprehension.

**Overall Assessment:**
Model 1 sacrifices some content for brevity. Model 2 provides a good balance of explanation and simplicity. Model 3 offers the most support for learners but may be overly explanatory.

Strengths: Maintains clear sentence structure and uses appropriate B1 vocabulary. Successfully simplifies ""mass-produced"" to ""produced very efficiently"" and ""cloned"" to ""copied."" The translation flows well and covers all main points.

Weaknesses: Uses ""ruled the plantations"" which may be slightly advanced for B1 level. The phrase ""copied shoots from plant stems"" could be clearer about the cloning process.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses shorter sentences which aids B1 comprehension. Breaks down complex ideas into digestible parts. Explains the cloning process clearly with ""copied (cloned) new shoots."" Good use of simple connectors and clear paragraph structure.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""tightly packed fields"" uses vocabulary that may be challenging for B1 learners. Some sentences could flow better between paragraphs.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides explicit explanation of cloning with ""cloning (making copies of)"" which helps B1 learners understand the concept. Uses clear, simple vocabulary throughout. Maintains good sentence structure while simplifying complex ideas.

Weaknesses: Uses bold formatting for ""cloning"" which is unnecessary for a B1 text adaptation. The phrase ""produced many bananas quickly"" slightly changes the meaning from the original's emphasis on efficiency and mass production.

Strengths: Clear and concise language appropriate for B1 level. Maintains all key information from the original text. Uses simple sentence structures that are easy to follow.

Weaknesses: Loses some specificity by changing ""prey"" to a more general concept without clarification that spiders primarily eat insects. The phrase ""throw a cloud of tiny hairs"" is less precise than the original ""ejecting."" Does not explain what antivenom is, which could be helpful for B1 learners.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful clarification by specifying ""insects they eat"" instead of just ""prey."" Includes a clear explanation of antivenom in parentheses, which aids comprehension. Introduces and explains the technical term ""urticating hairs"" with its definition.

Weaknesses: Omits the idiomatic expression ""rub up the wrong way"" entirely, losing some of the original's meaning about proper handling. The text is slightly longer, which may affect readability flow.

Strengths: Retains the idiomatic meaning of ""rub up the wrong way"" by translating it to ""handle...the wrong way."" Includes both the technical term ""urticating hairs"" and its explanation. Specifies ""insects they eat"" for better clarity. Maintains the complete meaning of the original text.

Weaknesses: Places the antivenom explanation in parentheses mid-sentence, which may disrupt reading flow. The final sentence is somewhat lengthy and complex for B1 level.

Strengths: Successfully simplifies ""cliché"" to ""movie idea"" and maintains clear sentence structure. Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary throughout. The translation flows naturally and preserves the main meaning.

Weaknesses: Omits ""resourceful"" entirely, which removes an important character trait. ""Most clever person in the world"" becomes just ""most clever person,"" losing the hyperbolic emphasis of the original.

Strengths: Converts ""late 20th century"" to the more accessible ""late 1900s."" Maintains clear structure and uses simple vocabulary appropriate for B1 level.

Weaknesses: Changes ""toughest"" to ""strongest,"" which alters the meaning slightly. Like Model 1, completely omits ""resourceful"" without replacement. Also removes ""in the world"" from the comparison.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses ""late 1900s"" for better comprehension. Addresses the ""resourceful"" concept by adding an explanatory phrase ""she can solve problems and use what she has,"" which helps B1 learners understand this more complex trait. Specifies ""movies made in"" for additional clarity.

Weaknesses: The added explanation makes the sentence longer and potentially more complex than typical B1 level. The hyphen usage may not be standard for this level.

Strengths: Uses clear, simple vocabulary appropriate for B1 level. The sentence structure is straightforward and accessible. Successfully simplifies ""artefacts"" to ""tools"" and maintains good flow throughout.
Weaknesses: Changes ""artefacts"" to ""tools"" which alters the meaning slightly, as artefacts include more than just tools. Omits the specific mention of ""evolutionary biologists,"" simply using ""scientists."" The phrase ""had learned to make"" suggests conscious learning rather than evolutionary development.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the original meaning most accurately. Keeps ""artefacts"" but provides explanation in parentheses, which is helpful for B1 learners. Uses appropriate vocabulary level while preserving technical accuracy. The phrase ""changed over time"" effectively explains evolutionary development.
Weaknesses: Slightly more complex sentence structures in some places. The parenthetical explanation of artefacts, while helpful, adds complexity to the sentence structure.

Strengths: Provides helpful explanations for technical terms like ""evolutionary biologists"" in parentheses. Uses clear, simple language throughout. Mentions ""fossils"" which is more specific and accurate than ""remains.""
Weaknesses: Contains a grammatical error: ""what kind of speech they could"" is incomplete (missing ""make"" or similar). Changes ""artefacts"" to ""tools and objects"" which is somewhat redundant. The parenthetical explanations, while helpful, make sentences longer and more complex.

A survey shows that both students and staff think the paper is very useful for entertainment, learning about culture (different customs and arts), and getting work experience. Printing the newspaper costs a lot of money. Some students also find it hard to get a copy because they have to go to the campus in person. Another problem is that many copies are thrown away and become litter on the campus, which harms the environment.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level. Maintains all key information from the original text. Sentence structure is straightforward and accessible.
Weaknesses: Loses some precision in translation - ""cultural enrichment"" becomes just ""culture"" without explanation. The phrase ""hurts the environment"" is somewhat vague compared to the original's more specific environmental concern.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful clarification by keeping ""cultural enrichment"" and adding an explanation in parentheses. Maintains clear B1-level vocabulary while preserving more of the original meaning. Good use of transitional phrases like ""Another problem is.""
Weaknesses: The explanation ""(cultural enrichment)"" might be slightly redundant since it repeats the same concept. Some sentences could be more concise.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Offers the most detailed explanation of ""cultural enrichment"" by specifying ""different customs and arts."" Uses varied vocabulary like ""handed out"" and ""thrown away."" Provides clear cause-and-effect relationships, particularly in the environmental impact section.
Weaknesses: The explanation of cultural enrichment may be overly specific and potentially limiting the broader concept. Slightly more complex sentence structures that approach B2 level rather than staying firmly at B1.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three models successfully adapt the text to B1 level and maintain factual accuracy. Model 1 prioritizes simplicity but sacrifices some meaning. Model 2 balances clarity with completeness. Model 3 provides the most comprehensive explanations but risks exceeding B1 complexity in some areas.

118-b1,"At Girox Foods, we are experiencing an annual employee turnover of about 12 per cent. Although this might not seem high at first glance, the industry standard is seven per cent. The principal objective of this report is to investigate the causes of employee engagement within the firm and, based on those, offer recommendations to improve the employees' experience of the workplace and increase employee retention.",gpt-oss-120b,"At Girox Foods, about 12 % of employees leave each year.

This may not look very high, but the usual rate in our industry is only 7 %. The main goal of this report is to look at why employees feel involved at work (employee engagement) and, based on that, give suggestions to make the workplace better and keep more staff for a longer time.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses clear, simple language appropriate for B1 level. Successfully simplifies ""annual employee turnover"" to ""employees leave each year."" Maintains the core meaning while reducing complexity.

Weaknesses: Contains a significant error by stating employees are ""not engaged"" when the original discusses investigating ""causes of employee engagement"" (not lack thereof). Omits the comparison aspect (""Although this might not seem high at first glance"") and loses some nuance in the explanation.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Correctly interprets the turnover comparison by stating ""This is higher than the usual 7%"" which captures the problematic nature of the situation. Provides helpful clarification with ""(engaged)"" to explain the term. Maintains accuracy regarding employee engagement investigation.

Weaknesses: Loses the original's acknowledgment that 12% ""might not seem high at first glance,"" which provides important context. The phrase ""feel involved (engaged)"" slightly changes the meaning from investigating engagement causes to examining feelings.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains the original's perspective with ""may not look very high"" while clarifying the comparison. Provides clear explanation with ""(employee engagement)"" in parentheses. Uses ""our staff"" and ""our industry"" which maintains the company perspective. Includes comprehensive details like ""keep more staff for a longer time.""

Weaknesses: Adds ""our"" which wasn't in the original text, though this doesn't significantly alter meaning. Slightly verbose compared to other B1 adaptations.

All three translations successfully reduce vocabulary complexity and sentence length appropriate for B1 level. Model 1 contains a factual error about employee engagement. Model 2 provides accurate information but loses some contextual nuance. Model 3 maintains the most complete information while remaining accessible.

119-b1,"So much of what the speaker said rang true. I honestly believe there's a danger that the more connected we are, the more isolated we feel. I don't think this is such an issue for my generation who've lived without technology for so long. We know how to be alone and, more importantly, we know that it's OK to be alone. But the under 20s are another kettle of fish. They're so busy communicating that they never experience the feeling of solitude and run the risk of not learning how to enjoy their own company. In addition, they're learning conversation through messages that can be edited and changed at the expense of learning the art of real conversation in real time with the person in front of you.",gpt-oss-120b,"A lot of what the speaker said felt true. I think there is a danger that the more we are connected, the more alone we feel. I don’t think this is a big problem for my generation, because we lived without technology for a long time. We know how to be alone and we know it is OK to be alone. But people under 20 are different. They are always talking, so they never feel solitude and may not learn how to enjoy their own company. Also, they learn to talk by sending messages that can be edited, which means they miss learning real‑time conversation with the person in front of them.","A lot of what the speaker said sounded true. I really think there is a danger that the more we are connected, the more lonely we feel. I don’t think this is a big problem for my generation, because we have lived without technology for a long time. We know how to be alone and, more importantly, we know that it is okay to be alone.  

But people under 20 years old are a different story. They are always busy talking to others, so they never feel alone and may not learn how to enjoy their own company. Also, they learn to talk by sending messages that can be edited (changed before they are sent) instead of learning the skill of real conversation in real time with the person in front of them.","Much of what the speaker said felt true. I really think that the more we are connected, the more lonely we can feel. This is not a big problem for my generation because we grew up without a lot of technology. We know how to be alone and we know that being alone is okay.  

But people under 20 are different. They are always talking on phones or online, so they rarely feel alone. Because of that, they may not learn how to enjoy their own company. They also learn to talk by sending messages that they can edit (change) before sending. This can stop them from learning how to have real, face‑to‑face conversations in the moment.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the core message effectively and uses appropriate B1-level vocabulary. The sentence structure is clear and accessible. Successfully conveys the contrast between generations.

Weaknesses: Loses the idiomatic expression ""another kettle of fish"" without replacement. The phrase ""always talking"" is less precise than the original ""so busy communicating."" The final sentence about conversation skills is somewhat simplified and loses nuance about the trade-off between edited messages and real-time interaction.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Preserves key phrases like ""more importantly"" and maintains good flow. Includes helpful clarification with ""(changed before they are sent)"" for B1 learners. Uses ""different story"" as an appropriate substitute for the idiom. The explanation of message editing is clear.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""always busy talking to others"" changes the meaning slightly from the broader concept of ""communicating."" Some sentences could be more concise for B1 level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides specific context with ""talking on phones or online"" which helps B1 learners understand the communication methods. Uses ""face-to-face conversations"" which is clearer than ""real conversation."" The explanation of editing messages is well-integrated with parenthetical clarification.

Weaknesses: ""Much of what"" is slightly more complex than necessary for B1. The phrase ""rarely feel alone"" changes the meaning from ""never experience solitude."" The final sentence structure is somewhat complex for the target level.

All three translations successfully adapt the text for B1 level by simplifying vocabulary and sentence structures while maintaining the essential meaning. They each handle the idiomatic expression appropriately by either replacing it or omitting it.

120-b1,"Don't always follow positive feedback with negative feedback. When positive and negative feedback always appear to go hand in hand, the positives can become devalued and ignored.

If you always mix positive and negative feedback together, the good comments can lose their value and be ignored. Make sure you sometimes give positive feedback just because it is positive, and try not to feel the urge to give constructive criticism (helpful advice that shows how to improve).","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simpler vocabulary (""add"" instead of ""follow,"" ""good comments"" instead of ""positives""). The phrase ""try not to feel the urge"" effectively conveys the original meaning of ""resist the temptation."" Maintains clear structure and meaning.

Weaknesses: ""Constructive criticism"" remains unchanged, which may be challenging for B1 learners. The simplification is adequate but could be more thorough.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses concrete, accessible language (""put a negative comment right after a positive one""). Simplifies ""constructive"" to ""helpful,"" making it more B1-appropriate. Clear temporal reference with ""at the same time.""

Weaknesses: The phrase ""just for its own sake"" appears twice without simplification, which may confuse B1 learners as this idiom can be difficult to understand.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides explicit definition of ""constructive criticism"" with ""(helpful advice that shows how to improve),"" which directly supports B1 comprehension. Uses simple vocabulary throughout. The explanation ""just because it is positive"" clarifies the idiomatic expression.

Weaknesses: Slightly longer due to the added explanation, but this serves the pedagogical purpose for the target level.

All three translations preserve the original meaning and use appropriate B1-level sentence structures. The key differentiator is how well each addresses potentially challenging vocabulary and concepts for B1 learners.
