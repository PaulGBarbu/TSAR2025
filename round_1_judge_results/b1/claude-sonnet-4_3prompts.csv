Common dreams like flying or falling, losing your teeth or being naked in public probably mean similar things for most people. But to understand exactly what they mean for you, you need to think about what is happening in your real life and how you feel about it.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple, clear vocabulary appropriate for B1 level. The sentence structure is straightforward and accessible. Successfully simplifies ""insights into things"" to ""things you didn't know you were thinking about.""

Weaknesses: Loses the nuance of ""insights"" by oversimplifying. Changes ""having no clothes on"" to ""being naked,"" which may be too direct for some B1 learners. The phrase ""what happens in your real life"" is somewhat awkward compared to ""daily life.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the concept of ""insights"" by using ""important things,"" which preserves more of the original meaning. Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary throughout. The structure flows well and maintains the original's conditional tone with ""might.""

Weaknesses: The phrase ""thoughts you didn't know you had"" is slightly more complex than necessary for B1. ""Really mean"" adds emphasis not present in the original.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses ""interesting things"" to maintain the concept of insights while keeping language accessible. Preserves ""exactly"" from the original text. The sentence structure closely mirrors the original while remaining clear for B1 learners.

Weaknesses: ""Interesting things"" may not fully capture the depth of ""insights."" The overall simplification is perhaps less thorough than the other models.

All three models successfully adapt the text to B1 level by shortening sentences, using simpler vocabulary, and maintaining the core message. Model 2 best balances simplification with meaning preservation, while Model 1 prioritizes clarity over nuance, and Model 3 stays closest to the original structure.

Strengths: Uses simpler vocabulary appropriate for B1 level (""examples"" instead of ""cases,"" ""groups"" instead of ""packs,"" ""learned to live very well"" instead of ""adapted remarkably successfully""). The sentence structure is clear and accessible.

Weaknesses: Changes ""while"" to ""and,"" which removes the contrast between the two types of dogs. The phrase ""pets that their owners left behind"" is slightly awkward grammatically.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the original contrast with ""while"" between born wild dogs and abandoned pets. Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary with ""examples,"" ""groups,"" and simplified phrasing. The text flows naturally.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""pets that their owners left behind"" remains grammatically awkward, though the meaning is clear.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very accessible B1 vocabulary (""by themselves"" instead of ""alone,"" ""road"" instead of ""street""). The phrase ""used to be pets but their owners left them"" is clearer than the other models' versions. The sentence structure variation with ""how to live in the city"" adds natural flow.

Weaknesses: Changes ""and"" to a comma in the final sentence, which slightly alters the original structure. Some word choices like ""road"" instead of ""street"" change the original meaning slightly.

All three models successfully simplify complex vocabulary and maintain the core meaning. Model 2 preserves the original contrast and structure most faithfully while using appropriate B1 vocabulary. Model 3 provides the clearest explanation of abandoned pets but makes more structural changes. Model 1 loses some original meaning by removing the contrast.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level. Successfully simplifies complex terms like ""facial deformities"" to ""face problems"" and ""bestseller"" to ""very popular."" Maintains the core message while reducing sentence complexity.

Weaknesses: Loses important information by omitting that Palacio is a New Yorker writer and that Wonder is specifically a novel. The phrase ""face problems"" is somewhat unclear compared to other models' alternatives.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains more detail from the original text, including the reference to The New Yorker. Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary like ""excited"" and ""help students talk about."" Maintains good flow and readability.

Weaknesses: Contains a factual error - RJ Palacio is not identified as writing ""for The New Yorker magazine"" in the original; ""New Yorker"" refers to her being from New York. This misinterpretation changes the meaning significantly.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Correctly interprets ""New Yorker"" as referring to someone from New York rather than the magazine. Uses clear, accessible language like ""a face that looked different"" which is more descriptive than ""face problems."" Maintains appropriate B1 complexity while preserving key information.

Weaknesses: Minor loss of specificity by not mentioning that Wonder is a novel, though this is a relatively small omission compared to other issues in the translations.

**Overall Assessment:**
Model 3 provides the most accurate translation while maintaining B1 accessibility. Model 1 offers good simplification but loses some important details. Model 2, despite good language use, contains a significant factual error that affects comprehension.

Strengths: Uses clear, simple vocabulary appropriate for B1 level. The sentence structure is straightforward and easy to follow. Successfully conveys the main ideas about Chloe's experience with rats.

Weaknesses: Loses some nuance from the original text. ""She has lost count of the times she's patiently tried to explain"" becomes simply ""Many times, she has tried to tell people,"" which removes the emphasis on patience and frequency. The phrase ""most people don't like rats as pets"" adds an interpretation not present in the original.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains good vocabulary level for B1. Preserves the idea that rats are ""unusual pets"" rather than making assumptions about people's preferences. Includes the detail about ""baby rats"" which adds clarity. The flow between sentences is natural.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""don't like the idea of pet rats"" is somewhat interpretive rather than directly reflecting the original's ""react badly."" Some of the original's emphasis on the repeated explanations is softened.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Stays closest to the original text's meaning and structure. Preserves the negative construction ""rats are not dirty"" which mirrors the original. Maintains the phrase ""not normal pets"" which closely matches ""not typical pets."" The sentence about seeing ""how loving and smart they were"" maintains the original's structure.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""not normal pets"" might be slightly less natural than ""unusual pets."" Some sentences could benefit from minor restructuring for smoother flow at B1 level.

All three models successfully simplify vocabulary and sentence structure for B1 level while maintaining the core narrative about Chloe's journey from disliking rats to becoming a pet owner.

The phrase ""squinted against the sun"" is simplified to just ""the sun was very bright,"" losing the specific action. The description of Carter's appearance lacks the nuanced contrast between his current state and usual indoor appearance.

Strengths: Preserves the atlas metaphor effectively. Includes the important contrast indicated by ""But usually he had the pale skin,"" which captures the original's ""Otherwise he had the indoor tan."" Maintains good narrative flow and character relationships.

Weaknesses: The opening phrase ""looked at the sun and saw dust"" creates a logical inconsistency - one cannot look directly at the sun and simultaneously see dust in the distance. This represents a significant comprehension error of the original text.

We will see if this plan works, but it might be difficult to win because warmer winters mean there are more pigs now than before.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level. Maintains the core message effectively. Good use of basic sentence structures.
Weaknesses: Oversimplifies some concepts - ""big arguments"" loses the intensity of ""heated arguments."" ""We don't know if this will work"" is less precise than the original's ""Time will tell."" Some nuance is lost in the simplification.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains more detail from the original text. ""Killing pigs with guns"" clearly explains ""shooting."" Preserves the comparative aspect ""more pigs now than before."" Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary while keeping meaning intact.
Weaknesses: ""Big fights"" is somewhat informal for the context. The phrase structure is occasionally awkward, such as ""gentler ways to deal with the pigs.""

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Balances simplification with accuracy well. ""Angry discussions"" better captures the tone than ""big fights."" Maintains the formal register more consistently. Preserves most original meaning while using accessible language.
Weaknesses: Very similar to Model 2 with minimal differentiation. Could have used slightly more varied vocabulary within B1 constraints.

**Comparison:**
Model 1 achieves the strongest simplification but sacrifices too much meaning and nuance. Model 2 retains good detail but uses some inappropriate informal language. Model 3 provides the best balance between accessibility and accuracy, maintaining appropriate register while preserving the original's meaning and tone.

All models successfully convey the main points and use vocabulary appropriate for B1 level learners. The sentence structures are simplified appropriately, and complex concepts are made more accessible.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for B1 level (""old Greek stories,"" ""fight back,"" ""big maze""). The sentence structure is clear and accessible. Successfully maintains the core narrative flow.

Weaknesses: Loses some important details from the original text, such as the specific mention that this was an ""important inspiration"" and the name ""Minos."" The phrase ""modern Theseus"" doesn't capture the futuristic aspect as clearly as the original ""futuristic Theseus.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains the opening phrase ""important inspiration,"" preserving the text's emphasis. Includes helpful parenthetical explanation of ""maze."" Maintains most key details including ""King Minos."" The phrase ""modern version of Theseus set in the future"" effectively conveys the original meaning.

Weaknesses: Slightly more complex sentence structures that may challenge some B1 learners. The parenthetical explanation, while helpful, adds length to an already complex sentence.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides a clear parenthetical explanation of ""maze"" that is more detailed than Model 2's version. Uses ""To punish them"" as a clear transition. Maintains most essential story elements and character names.

Weaknesses: Changes ""important inspiration"" to ""important idea,"" which slightly alters the meaning. The phrase ""modern Theseus from the future"" is somewhat awkward and less precise than other versions. Some sentence structures remain complex for B1 level.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three models successfully adapt the text for B1 level by simplifying vocabulary and sentence structures. Model 2 maintains the highest fidelity to the original meaning while still being accessible. Model 1 achieves the greatest simplification but sacrifices some content accuracy.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level. Successfully simplifies complex concepts like ""conservation issues"" to ""protecting animals and their homes in nature."" Maintains the core meaning while using accessible vocabulary.

Weaknesses: Loses some nuance from the original text. The phrase ""potential to educate"" becomes simply ""can teach,"" which reduces the conditional nature. ""Important research"" is omitted, making the research seem less significant.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains more of the original meaning, including the inspirational aspect (""make people want to help save animals""). Preserves the emphasis on ""important research"" and includes the concept of curing diseases. Uses appropriate B1-level vocabulary while maintaining complexity.

Weaknesses: Some phrases like ""cure animal diseases"" may be slightly advanced for B1 level. The sentence structure remains relatively complex, which could challenge B1 learners.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the inspirational message effectively. Uses clear, accessible language throughout. The phrase ""help sick animals get better"" is more B1-appropriate than ""cure diseases."" Preserves the main ideas while simplifying vocabulary.

Weaknesses: Changes ""important research"" to ""important studies,"" which slightly alters the academic tone. The connector ""so"" changes the logical relationship from the original ""have the potential to"" structure.

Weaknesses: Some word choices could be more precise (e.g., ""has all the power"" is less specific than ""complete control""). The phrase ""makes coal"" is slightly inaccurate since coal is mined, not manufactured.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful clarification by explaining coal as ""black rock used for energy,"" which aids B1 learners' comprehension. Uses appropriate vocabulary level while maintaining clarity. Includes the word ""now"" which helps establish the temporal context.
Weaknesses: Slightly longer due to the explanatory addition, which may not be necessary for all B1 learners. The verb ""digs"" is more accurate than ""makes"" but could be simplified further.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses clear, simple language suitable for B1 level. Maintains good flow and readability. The phrase ""gives all the coal"" accurately reflects the original meaning.
Weaknesses: Uses ""has to"" instead of ""must,"" which is less formal but still appropriate. The repetition of ""the Capitol"" in the final sentence creates slight redundancy.

Strengths: Maintains most of the original meaning and structure while simplifying vocabulary appropriately. Uses ""first movie directors"" instead of ""early film directors"" which works well for B1 level. Keeps the flow of the original text.

Weaknesses: Uses ""asks them to go on an adventure"" which is awkward phrasing - ""calls them"" would be more natural. Ends with ""begins the hero's trip"" instead of ""journey,"" which is inconsistent with the established terminology.

**Model 3 Feedback:**
Strengths: Preserves the original meaning most accurately, including the important word ""directly."" Maintains consistent terminology by using ""journey"" throughout. Uses appropriate B1-level vocabulary while keeping the natural flow of the text.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level. Successfully simplifies ""underutilised items"" to ""things that people don't use much."" Maintains the core meaning while making it accessible. The sentence structure is straightforward and easy to follow.

Weaknesses: Uses ""second-hand items"" which may be slightly more complex than necessary for B1. The term ""asset"" is simplified to ""valuable"" which works well, but some nuance is lost.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Similar to Model 1 with clear, simple language. Uses ""worthless"" which provides good contrast to ""valuable."" Simplifies ""second-hand goods"" to ""used goods"" which is more accessible. Maintains good flow and readability.

Weaknesses: The explanation remains somewhat incomplete for B1 learners who might need more context about what the sharing economy actually involves.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides the most comprehensive explanation by adding a clarifying phrase ""(when people share or rent things they own to make money)"" which helps B1 learners understand the concept better. Uses simple vocabulary throughout. The additional explanation makes the concept more concrete.

Weaknesses: The added explanation, while helpful, makes the text slightly longer and could be seen as over-explaining. However, this is generally beneficial for the target level.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three models successfully adapt the text to B1 level by using simpler vocabulary and sentence structures. They all replace complex terms like ""underutilised,"" ""advent,"" and ""peer-to-peer"" with more accessible alternatives. The main differences lie in word choices for describing used items and the level of explanation provided for the sharing economy concept.

Model 3 provides the most support for B1 learners by including an explanatory definition. Model 2 uses slightly more accessible vocabulary with ""used goods"" instead of ""second-hand items."" Model 1 maintains clarity but offers the least additional support for comprehension.

Weaknesses: Loses some nuance from the original text, particularly the phrase ""conscious mind"" which becomes simply ""minds."" The explanation of the second theory is somewhat simplified, missing the concept that the brain activity occurs ""while organizing memories.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes helpful clarification about Freud being ""a famous doctor who studied the mind,"" which aids B1 comprehension. Maintains the contrast between theories clearly and uses appropriate vocabulary level. The phrase ""makes sense"" effectively conveys the original meaning.

Weaknesses: The addition about Freud, while helpful, slightly changes the focus from understanding feelings to dreams helping understand them. Some of the original's precision is lost in simplification.

Strengths:
- Uses simpler vocabulary appropriate for B1 level (""old clothes"" instead of ""unwanted clothes"")
- Maintains clear sentence structure
- Preserves the main message about charity shops and environmental problems

Weaknesses:
- Changes ""disposable clothing problem"" to ""clothing waste problem,"" which alters the specific concept
- ""Quality is often too bad to use again"" loses the specific meaning of ""recycle""
- ""Go to other countries"" is less precise than ""sent abroad""
- Final sentence structure is awkward and unclear about what types of problems are created

**Model 2 Analysis:**

Strengths:
- Provides helpful explanation of 'fast fashion' in parentheses
- Uses B1-appropriate vocabulary (""cheap clothes,"" ""thrown in the trash"")
- Clearly explains the economic and environmental consequences
- Good use of ""damages the environment"" for clarity

Weaknesses:
- ""Cheap clothing problem"" significantly changes the meaning from ""disposable clothing problem""
- ""Follow the latest styles"" adds information not in the original
- ""Money problems"" is somewhat vague compared to ""economic problems""

**Model 3 Analysis:**

Strengths:
- ""Throwaway clothing problem"" accurately captures ""disposable clothing problem""
- Includes helpful explanation of 'fast fashion'
- Maintains the concept of recycling from the original
- Adds clarifying ""there too"" to specify where environmental damage occurs
- Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary while staying close to original meaning

Weaknesses:
- ""Follow the newest styles"" adds information not present in the original
- Slightly longer sentences may challenge some B1 readers

Model 3 stays closest to the original meaning while successfully adapting language for B1 level. Model 1 maintains good simplicity but loses important nuances. Model 2 provides clear explanations but changes key concepts.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level. Maintains the core meaning while simplifying complex phrases like ""started out"" to ""began."" The sentence structure is straightforward and accessible.

Weaknesses: Omits ""different"" when referring to social problems, which slightly reduces the scope of the original meaning. Changes ""encourage"" to ""help,"" which is a minor semantic shift but acceptable for the level.

**Model 2 Feedback:**

Strengths: Provides helpful clarification with ""(people who don't have homes)"" which aids B1 learners' comprehension. Uses ""Today"" instead of ""Nowadays"" which is more familiar vocabulary. Maintains the meaning of ""different social problems.""

Weaknesses: The parenthetical explanation, while helpful, makes the sentence longer and potentially more complex for B1 readers. Uses ""local people"" instead of ""residents,"" which changes the register slightly.

**Model 3 Feedback:**

Strengths: Uses ""problems in society"" which breaks down the compound term ""social problems"" into more basic vocabulary. Includes ""different"" to preserve the original scope. Uses ""local people"" which is simpler than ""residents.""

Weaknesses: The final phrase ""the problem of people who don't have homes"" is unnecessarily wordy and repetitive since ""homeless people"" was already used. This creates redundancy rather than clarity. The phrase ""think more about"" adds an intensifier not present in the original.

Strengths:
- Uses very simple vocabulary appropriate for B1 level (""goes around"" instead of ""orbits"")
- Breaks down complex concepts into shorter, clearer sentences
- Explains the relationship between the asteroids in accessible terms
- Uses ""change how it moves"" which is easier to understand than technical orbital terminology

Weaknesses:
- Omits the specific name ""Didymoon"" 
- Loses some precision by saying ""change how it moves"" rather than specifically addressing orbital changes
- Slightly repetitive with ""small moon"" used multiple times

**Model 2 Feedback:**

Strengths:
- Retains the original term ""Didymoon"" which maintains accuracy
- Uses ""push it out of its normal path"" which effectively simplifies ""knock it out of its orbit""
- Maintains good sentence flow while simplifying vocabulary
- Preserves the cause-and-effect relationship clearly

Weaknesses:
- Uses ""mother asteroid"" which may be slightly confusing without further explanation
- ""Normal path"" might be less precise than needed for understanding the concept

**Model 3 Feedback:**

Strengths:
- Keeps the specific name ""Didymoon"" for accuracy
- Uses simple vocabulary while maintaining technical precision
- ""Change its path"" is clear and appropriate for B1 level
- Maintains the logical structure of the original text

Weaknesses:
- Uses ""mother asteroid"" without clarification
- The phrase ""so that telescopes"" creates a slightly awkward sentence structure
- Less explicit about the nature of the orbital relationship

All three models successfully adapt the text to B1 level by simplifying vocabulary and sentence structures. Model 2 provides the best balance between accessibility and accuracy, while Model 1 prioritizes simplicity but loses some precision. Model 3 maintains good accuracy but has minor structural issues.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear sentence structures appropriate for B1 level. Maintains all key plot points and character names. The vocabulary is accessible and straightforward.

Weaknesses: Changes ""heroine"" to ""main character,"" losing some specificity. ""Says she will go"" is less precise than ""volunteers."" ""Difficult relationship"" oversimplifies the nuanced ""complicated relationship"" from the original.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful clarification by explaining ""tributes"" as ""people chosen to fight"" in parentheses, which aids B1 comprehension. Maintains the causal relationship with ""so"" connecting her father's death to her need to provide food. Uses ""goes hunting"" which is clearer than just ""hunts.""

Weaknesses: ""Difficult feelings about their relationship"" changes the meaning from the relationship itself being complicated to Katniss having feelings about it. This shifts the focus incorrectly.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides the most detailed explanation of the mining accident (""at the mine where he worked""), giving helpful context. Includes the parenthetical explanation of tributes like Model 2. ""Discovers that her relationship with him is not simple"" maintains the complexity of the original while using B1-appropriate language.

Weaknesses: Slightly more complex sentence structure in some places, though still within B1 range.

**Ranking Analysis:**
Model 3 preserves the meaning most accurately while providing necessary context for B1 learners. Model 2 provides good clarification but alters the meaning of the relationship complexity. Model 1, while clear and simple, loses some important nuances and precision from the original text.

Strengths: Uses simple sentence structures and basic vocabulary appropriate for B1 level. The message is clear and accessible.
Weaknesses: Loses some nuance from the original text. ""They are important too"" is less precise than explaining they might add meaning. Changes ""over the period of a week"" to ""after one week,"" which slightly alters the meaning. Uses ""real life"" instead of ""daily life,"" which changes the original phrasing.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains good B1-level vocabulary while preserving more of the original meaning. Includes the concept that details ""help you understand what the dream means."" Uses appropriate connecting words like ""when"" and maintains logical flow.
Weaknesses: Uses ""surprised by"" instead of ""surprised how much,"" which is a minor structural change. The phrase ""see how your dreams connect"" adds a word not in the original.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Preserves the original meaning most accurately, including ""might be important"" which maintains the tentative tone of the original. Keeps ""start to remember"" from the original text. Maintains the uncertainty aspect with ""might be important for understanding.""
Weaknesses: Slightly more complex sentence structure in the second sentence, though still within B1 range. The phrase ""start to see how"" adds words not in the original.

**Comparison:**
All three models successfully adapt the text to B1 level. Model 1 simplifies most but loses some meaning. Model 2 maintains good balance between simplicity and meaning preservation. Model 3 stays closest to the original meaning and tone while remaining accessible.

This was especially a problem with old train bridges, where sparks from the metal wheels hitting the metal tracks could sometimes make a bridge start burning and burn down completely.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple, clear vocabulary appropriate for B1 level. Maintains the core meaning while simplifying complex phrases like ""susceptible to fire"" to ""could catch fire easily."" The sentence structure is straightforward and accessible.

Weaknesses: Changes ""steel wheels and steel tracks"" to just ""steel wheels on steel tracks,"" which slightly alters the original meaning. The phrase ""burn to the ground"" is simplified to ""burn down completely,"" which is acceptable but loses some specificity.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Effectively simplifies vocabulary while preserving meaning. Uses ""built from wood"" instead of ""made of wood,"" which adds slight variety. The phrase ""hitting the steel tracks"" provides clearer causation for the sparks. Maintains ""steel"" rather than changing to ""metal.""

Weaknesses: Changes ""particularly true"" to ""especially common,"" which shifts the emphasis slightly. The phrase ""start a fire that would burn down"" is somewhat wordy for B1 level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Simplifies complex vocabulary appropriately. Uses ""especially a problem"" which clearly indicates the issue. The phrase ""start burning"" is simple and clear.

Weaknesses: Changes ""steel"" to ""metal,"" which is less specific than the original. The phrase ""could catch fire much more easily"" adds ""much more"" which wasn't in the original. Uses ""metal wheels hitting the metal tracks"" which changes the material specification from the original.

**Ranking:**
All three translations successfully adapt the text to B1 level. Model 1 maintains the closest adherence to the original vocabulary (keeping ""steel"").

She also liked this time of day because she could play with her pet rats.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple sentence structures appropriate for B1 level. Vocabulary is accessible and clear.
Weaknesses: Breaks the original compound sentence into choppy fragments (""made a cup of coffee. She went to her bedroom with it""), which reduces natural flow. Changes ""beloved"" to generic description, losing some character detail. Omits ""took it up"" detail about going upstairs.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains good sentence flow while keeping language simple. Uses ""Soon the house would be full of"" which adds temporal clarity. Vocabulary remains at appropriate B1 level.
Weaknesses: Changes ""beloved jazz"" to ""favorite jazz music,"" slightly altering the original meaning. Uses ""playing"" instead of ""listening to"" which changes the activity description. Adds ""Soon"" which isn't in the original text.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Preserves most original details including ""made herself,"" ""up to her bedroom,"" and ""some homework."" Maintains ""listening to"" rather than changing to ""playing."" Keeps ""this time of day"" phrase from original.
Weaknesses: Retains ""became noisy"" which might be slightly more complex than other options. Uses ""favorite"" instead of ""beloved"" but this is minor.

**Comparative Assessment:**
Model 3 maintains the highest fidelity to the original text while keeping language accessible. Model 2 flows well but makes unnecessary changes to meaning. Model 1 oversimplifies to the point of creating awkward sentence breaks and losing narrative cohesion.

Strengths: Uses simpler vocabulary (""space protection team,"" ""dangerous"" instead of ""significant danger""), maintains technical accuracy, and presents information clearly at B1 level.
Weaknesses: Splits the final information into two separate sentences, which slightly fragments the flow compared to the original structure.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains good sentence structure, uses appropriate B1 vocabulary, and preserves the technical term ""serious threat"" which is accessible at this level.
Weaknesses: Uses ""close to Earth"" instead of ""near Earth"" which slightly changes the technical precision, and the phrasing ""find and record"" adds unnecessary repetition.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very clear, accessible language (""team that protects our planet""), maintains logical flow by combining the final information into one sentence, and preserves the contrast between unknown and known asteroids effectively.
Weaknesses: The phrase ""team that protects our planet"" is somewhat more interpretive than the original ""planetary defence team,"" though still accurate.

All three models successfully simplify ""measuring 1km wide"" to ""that are 1km wide,"" replace ""Earth's orbit"" with ""Earth's path around the sun,"" and convert ""50 left to log"" to more accessible phrasing. Each maintains the key technical information while making it comprehensible at B1 level.

Model 3 provides the clearest logical flow and most natural sentence combining. Model 1 offers good simplification but with slight structural fragmentation. Model 2 maintains accuracy but includes minor redundancies and less precise terminology.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear vocabulary appropriate for B1 level. Maintains the core narrative structure and key plot points. The sentence ""Then something surprising and scary happens"" effectively simplifies the complex original phrasing.

Weaknesses: Loses some important nuances from the original text. ""Because of his face"" is less precise than the original ""because of the way he looks."" Omits the specific reference to ""the plague"" which is significant to the story. The phrase ""many good and bad times"" oversimplifies ""intense ups and downs.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains more detail from the original text, including the specific mention of ""the plague."" Maintains the temporal flow with ""After deciding"" and ""until finally."" Includes helpful clarification ""(a serious disease)"" for B1 learners.

Weaknesses: Contains the awkward phrase ""many difficult good and bad times"" which is grammatically confusing. The addition of the explanatory phrase about plague, while helpful, slightly disrupts the text flow.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides clear, accessible language while preserving most key details. Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary like ""deal with"" and ""finds out."" Maintains good sentence structure and flow. The phrase ""because of how his face looks"" is more specific than Model 1's version.

Weaknesses: Removes the specific reference to ""the plague,"" replacing it with the more generic ""getting sick from him,"" which loses some of the original's meaning about the children's superstitious behavior.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level. Maintains the core meaning of the original text. The sentence ""It went on and on, very far"" effectively conveys the vastness.

Weaknesses: Loses some nuance, particularly ""rebellious"" is omitted entirely. ""Hitting the ground with its feet"" is less precise than describing the horse's hooves. The phrase ""cause many problems"" is somewhat vague compared to ""get into trouble.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains more of the original meaning, including both ""bored and angry"" (capturing rebellious). Uses ""hard to see"" which better reflects ""barely visible."" Maintains the contrast between good riders and inexperienced ones effectively.

Weaknesses: ""Big feet"" is less accurate than hooves. Some sentences could be simplified further for B1 level. The structure remains quite close to the original, which may be slightly complex for the target level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Attempts to explain ""rebellious"" as ""didn't want to follow rules,"" which aids comprehension. Uses ""hardly see"" which appropriately translates ""barely visible."" Maintains the logical flow of the original argument.

Weaknesses: ""Didn't want to follow rules"" is an interpretation rather than translation of ""rebellious."" ""A person who knew how to ride well"" is wordier than necessary. ""Get into even more trouble"" changes the subtle uncertainty of ""maybe there was even more trouble.""

**Ranking:**
All three translations successfully adapt the text to B1 level while preserving the essential meaning. Model 2 maintains the best balance between simplification and accuracy, retaining key elements like the emotional state of the teenager and the precision of ""barely visible."" Model 1 provides the clearest simplification but loses some important details. Model 3 attempts helpful explanations but sometimes over-interprets the original text.

Strengths: Uses simple sentence structures appropriate for B1 level. Maintains factual accuracy and covers all key information from the original text.
Weaknesses: Breaks down complex sentences too much, creating choppy flow. The phrase ""after school"" is ambiguous - could mean daily after school rather than after completing education. Loses some cohesion present in the original.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes ""Mount Everest"" for clarity. Maintains good flow while using B1-appropriate vocabulary. Clearly states ""after she finished school"" to avoid ambiguity. Preserves most of the original's meaning and structure.
Weaknesses: The phrase ""terrible storms"" appears twice, creating repetition. ""Difficult things to do"" is somewhat vague compared to ""challenges.""

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains the comma structure from the original text in the first sentence. Uses ""even though"" to maintain the contrasting relationship between danger and climbers seeking challenges. Flows well and maintains coherence. Uses ""finished school"" for clarity.
Weaknesses: Keeps more complex sentence structures that may be challenging for B1 level readers. ""Tall mountains"" is less precise than ""high mountains.""

**Overall Assessment:**
All three models successfully simplify vocabulary and grammar for B1 level while maintaining factual accuracy. Model 1 oversimplifies to the point of losing flow.

Strengths: Uses simple sentence structures appropriate for B1 level. Clearly explains the oxygen concept with ""there is not much oxygen"" and ""your brain and body cannot work well."" Breaks down complex ideas into shorter, digestible sentences.

Weaknesses: Changes ""decided"" to ""wanted,"" altering the meaning slightly. Separates the charity explanation into two sentences when one would suffice. The phrase ""children who have no parents"" is more wordy than necessary.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the original meaning accurately with ""decided to climb."" Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary like ""extra oxygen from tanks."" Includes both ""poor children and children without parents"" which covers the original ""orphans"" concept clearly. Good sentence flow and structure.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""work badly"" is somewhat awkward - ""not work well"" would be more natural. Minor issue with sentence length in the final sentence.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Identical content to Model 2 with accurate meaning preservation. Uses clear B1-appropriate language. Maintains good sentence structure and vocabulary choices.

Weaknesses: Uses parentheses ""(over 8,000 metres high)"" which may be less accessible for B1 learners compared to a dash or separate explanation. Same ""work badly"" issue as Model 2.

**Key Differences:**
Model 1 oversimplifies by breaking information into very short sentences and changes some meaning. Models 2 and 3 are nearly identical except for punctuation - Model 2 uses a dash while Model 3 uses parentheses. Both Models 2 and 3 maintain better fidelity to the original text than Model 1.

Strengths:
- Uses simpler vocabulary appropriate for B1 level (""winter coat"" instead of ""woollen coat"")
- Maintains clear sentence structure
- Successfully conveys the main message
- ""Place to store things"" is appropriately simplified

Weaknesses:
- Loses some specificity by omitting ""woollen"" material description
- ""At some point in our lives"" becomes just ""in our lives,"" losing temporal nuance
- ""Guest room"" becomes ""extra room,"" losing the specific function

**Model 2 Analysis:**

Strengths:
- Retains ""wool coat"" which preserves material information while simplifying
- Maintains ""bedroom"" specificity
- Clear and accessible sentence structure
- Preserves the comparative aspect with ""newer one""

Weaknesses:
- ""Room for storing things"" is slightly more complex than necessary
- Could have simplified ""fashionable"" further

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and sentence structures appropriate for B1 level. The message is clear and concise.
Weaknesses: Oversimplifies the original text significantly. Loses the phrase ""across cultures"" and reduces ""insight"" to just ""knowledge."" The final sentence omits the specific mention of ""event, place or person"" and doesn't capture the temporal sequence as clearly.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for B1 level (""transport"" instead of ""transportation,"" ""important"" instead of ""crucial""). The sentence structure is straightforward and accessible.

Weaknesses: Loses some meaning by changing ""have involved building"" to ""are building,"" which alters the temporal aspect. ""Mountain gorges"" becomes ""mountain valleys,"" which is less precise. ""Fall down"" is overly simplistic for ""collapse"" and doesn't convey the technical nature of structural failure.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the original meaning more accurately with ""have been about building."" Provides helpful explanation of ""civil engineering"" in parentheses. ""Deep valleys between mountains"" clearly explains ""mountain gorges."" Uses ""fall down or break"" which better captures different types of structural failure.

Weaknesses: ""Costly"" may be slightly more advanced than necessary for B1. The explanation of civil engineering is somewhat lengthy, which could make the sentence harder to follow.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Preserves original meaning with ""have been about building."" Includes explanation of civil engineering. Uses clear, simple vocabulary throughout. ""Deep valleys between mountains"" effectively explains the concept. Maintains good sentence flow while simplifying.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for B1 level (""groups"" instead of ""packs,"" ""city trains"" instead of ""metro system""). The sentence structure is clear and accessible.
Weaknesses: Loses some meaning by changing ""are sent to beg"" to ""go to ask,"" which removes the strategic element. ""Good sense of smell"" is less precise than ""very good"" or ""excellent."" The final sentence structure is awkward and unclear.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the strategic meaning with ""are sent to ask."" Uses ""underground trains"" which is more specific than ""city trains."" Includes ""even"" to preserve emphasis. The final sentence flows better and is clearer than Model 1.
Weaknesses: Uses ""understand the names"" which may be slightly more complex than needed for B1 level. Minor redundancy with ""very good sense of smell.""

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Preserves ""smaller, cuter dogs"" maintaining the comparative aspect from the original. Keeps ""are sent to ask"" preserving the strategic element. Uses ""underground trains"" for clarity. Maintains good sentence flow throughout.
Weaknesses: Ends with ""places they like to go to"" which creates an unnecessary preposition at the end. Otherwise minimal issues with the translation.

All three models successfully simplify vocabulary and sentence structure for B1 level while maintaining the core meaning. The main differences lie in word choice precision, sentence flow, and how well they preserve the original meaning's nuances.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear sentence structures appropriate for B1 level. Vocabulary is accessible with phrases like ""comes to power,"" ""goes down,"" and ""gets into a small boat."" Successfully breaks complex sentences into shorter ones.

Weaknesses: Loses some narrative flow by oversimplifying sentence connections. The phrase ""die in the water"" is somewhat awkward. Omits the detail about taking animals with them, which affects story comprehension.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains good narrative flow while using B1-appropriate vocabulary. Includes helpful clarifications like ""people working on the ship"" for sailors and ""small rescue boat"" for lifeboat. Preserves important story details about taking remaining animals. Uses appropriate transitional phrases.

Weaknesses: Slightly longer sentences may challenge some B1 learners. The phrase ""goes down into the ocean"" adds unnecessary detail not in the original.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains most of the original's meaning while simplifying vocabulary. Uses clear B1-level expressions like ""what will happen next"" and ""goes down into the water."" Preserves the story's emotional impact with ""Very sadly.""

Weaknesses: The opening clause ""that his parents don't like"" creates a potentially confusing sentence structure for B1 learners. Some sentences remain quite long and complex for the target level.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three models successfully adapt the text to B1 level vocabulary and maintain the story's essential elements. Model 2 provides the best balance of clarity, completeness, and appropriate language level. Model 1 prioritizes simplicity but sacrifices some story coherence.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for B1 level. Successfully simplifies ""electronic copies"" to ""copies on computers and phones"" which is more accessible. Maintains all key information from the original.

Weaknesses: Breaks the text into very short, choppy sentences that may sound unnatural. The phrase ""young people's book"" is slightly awkward compared to ""book for young people.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains good sentence flow while keeping vocabulary accessible. Provides a clear explanation of electronic copies with ""(e-books that you read on computers or special devices)."" Preserves the distinction between ""teenagers and young adults"" from the original. Uses appropriate B1-level structures.

Weaknesses: The parenthetical explanation, while helpful, makes one sentence quite long for B1 level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains natural sentence structure and flow. Uses ""digital copies"" which is simpler than ""electronic copies"" while still being accurate. Provides a clear explanation in parentheses. Keeps most of the original's sentence complexity while remaining accessible.

Weaknesses: Some sentences are relatively long for B1 level, particularly the second sentence which combines multiple clauses.

**Ranking Analysis:**
Model 2 provides the best balance of accessibility and completeness, maintaining natural flow while explaining technical terms clearly. Model 3 follows closely with good simplification choices but slightly more complex sentence structures. Model 1, while very simple, sacrifices natural flow for accessibility.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level. Successfully simplifies complex concepts like ""organising"" to ""puts together"" and ""symbolic meaning"" to ""special meanings.""

Weaknesses: Omits the explicit mention of ""symbols"" which is present in the original text. The phrase ""thoughts are like words in our head"" is slightly awkward and less precise than the original meaning. Loses some specificity by not mentioning that thoughts ""mostly"" appear as words.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the symbolic aspect by explicitly mentioning ""like symbols."" Preserves the qualifier ""usually"" which reflects the original ""mostly."" Uses clear B1-appropriate vocabulary while retaining more of the original meaning. The sentence structure flows naturally.

Weaknesses: Uses ""because"" instead of maintaining the original tentative tone. The contrast conjunction ""while"" might be slightly more complex than necessary for B1 level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes explicit mention of symbols, maintaining key conceptual elements. Uses ""brain"" instead of ""mind"" in one instance, which adds variety. Preserves the qualifier ""usually"" and maintains clear sentence structure.

Weaknesses: Inconsistent terminology by switching between ""mind"" and ""brain"" within the same text. Uses ""because"" which changes the tentative tone of the original. The conjunction ""and"" in the final sentence creates a slightly different emphasis than the original ""while.""

**Overall Comparison:**
All three models successfully adapt the text to B1 level vocabulary and sentence complexity. Model 2 maintains the most faithful representation of the original meaning while using appropriate simplifications. Model 1 provides the simplest language but sacrifices some content accuracy. Model 3 has good content retention but suffers from terminology inconsistency.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for B1 level. Successfully simplifies complex phrases like ""self-disclosure"" by removing the term entirely. Maintains the core message about relationship importance.

Weaknesses: Loses the technical term ""self-disclosure"" completely, which reduces educational value. The phrase ""deep talks"" is somewhat informal and vague compared to the original concept. Omits the explanation that would help learners understand the concept.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains the technical term ""self-disclosure"" with a clear, accessible explanation in parentheses. Uses B1-appropriate vocabulary while maintaining precision. The phrase ""deep, honest conversations"" effectively conveys the original meaning. Adds ""researchers found"" which clarifies the study context.

Weaknesses: Slightly longer sentences that may challenge some B1 learners. The parenthetical explanation, while helpful, adds complexity to sentence structure.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides clear explanation of growth mindset concept. Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary while maintaining accuracy. Preserves the contrast between praising results versus process. Good use of transitional phrases like ""But research shows.""

Weaknesses: Changes ""organizing events"" to just ""organizing events"" without maintaining the professional context. The flow between sentences could be smoother in some places.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes a helpful definition of growth mindset in parentheses. Maintains the key concepts while using accessible language. Good preservation of the cause-and-effect relationship in the research findings. Uses varied sentence structures appropriate for B1 level.

Strengths: Keeps ""Personally"" and preserves the evolution concept. Maintains ""exactly that"" and adds ""in the future."" Uses ""adding technology to our bodies"" which clearly conveys augmentation. Shows good vocabulary variation with ""make our memory stronger.""
Weaknesses: Contains the same pronoun inconsistency as Model 2 (""you could put a computer inside our brain""). The phrase structure is very similar to Model 2.

**Ranking Analysis:**
Model 1 provides the clearest and most consistent language but loses important content. Models 2 and 3 preserve more original meaning but have pronoun consistency issues. Model 3 edges ahead with slightly better word choices like ""adding technology"" and ""make our memory stronger,"" while Model 2 has the awkward ""make our evolution faster"" phrasing.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear vocabulary appropriate for B1 level. Successfully simplifies complex phrases like ""hit the nail on the head"" to ""was right about."" Maintains the core meaning while using accessible language.

Weaknesses: Loses some specificity by changing ""social media"" to a more general concept and ""red light"" to ""traffic."" The phrase ""sit together quietly"" doesn't fully capture the contrast implied in the original ""sit together in silence.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains more specific details from the original, including explicit mention of ""Facebook or Instagram"" and ""traffic lights."" Maintains the rhetorical question structure effectively. Uses ""keep changing between"" which clearly conveys the switching behavior.

Weaknesses: ""Completely right"" may be slightly strong for B1 level compared to simpler alternatives. The phrase ""without talking"" is clear but could be more precise.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides specific social media examples and maintains detailed references like ""traffic lights."" Uses clear, simple sentence structures. The phrase ""talking to people in real life and talking to people online"" explicitly clarifies the contrast.

Weaknesses: Changes ""How can we expect"" to ""How can we tell,"" which slightly alters the meaning and reduces the sense of reasonableness in the expectation. ""Think about"" changes the introductory phrase unnecessarily.

**Ranking Analysis:**
Model 2 preserves the most original meaning while maintaining B1-appropriate language. It keeps the rhetorical structure and specific examples intact. Model 1 provides the clearest simplification but loses some important details. Model 3 makes unnecessary changes to the meaning while not offering significant improvements in clarity over Model 2.

Strengths: Clear and concise language appropriate for B1 level. Successfully simplifies complex phrases like ""dedicated her life"" to ""spent her life"" and ""witnessed numerous international humanitarian projects"" to ""seen many international projects."" Maintains the core message while using accessible vocabulary.

Weaknesses: Loses some nuance from the original text. The phrase ""once too often"" is simplified to ""often stop suddenly,"" which changes the meaning slightly. ""Doing the trick"" is translated to ""working well,"" which is accurate but less idiomatic. Some connecting phrases are simplified, making the text slightly choppy.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains good flow and coherence while simplifying language. Includes helpful clarification with ""(projects that help people)"" for humanitarian campaigns. Preserves more of the original meaning, particularly with ""too often these projects end"" which better captures the original sentiment. The ending ""take her seriously"" adds appropriate emphasis.

Weaknesses: Slightly more complex vocabulary in some places that might challenge B1 learners. The parenthetical explanation, while helpful, interrupts the text flow. Some phrases like ""realized that Bangladesh needed to help itself"" are more sophisticated than necessary for B1 level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple, clear language throughout. Good simplification of ""numerous international humanitarian projects"" to ""many international projects."" Maintains the chronological flow of the original text well. The phrase ""climbing mountains"" is more concrete than just ""mountain climbing.""

Weaknesses: ""Too many times"" is awkward phrasing compared to the original ""once too often."" The simplification of ""humanitarian campaigns"" to just ""helping people"" loses important context. The ending feels repetitive with both ""pay attention and notice,"" which could confuse B1 learners.

Weaknesses: Loses some nuance from the original, such as the specific phrase ""American dream"" and the concept of ""foot-tapping."" The phrase ""great music that you can dance to"" oversimplifies ""foot-tapping rock."" Some details are omitted, like the ""bitterness"" of the people described.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains important concepts like ""American dream"" while explaining it clearly for B1 readers. Maintains the contrast between catchy music and serious themes. Preserves the explanation of ""the Boss"" as Bruce Springsteen's nickname. Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary while keeping most original meaning.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""deep feelings"" appears twice, creating repetition. Some expressions like ""falls apart"" might be slightly advanced for B1 level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Attempts to maintain the ""foot-tapping"" concept with ""makes you want to move your feet."" Uses simple sentence structures and vocabulary. Clearly explains the contrast between music style and lyrical content.

Weaknesses: The translation ""makes you want to move your feet"" is awkward and unnatural. Loses the ""American dream"" concept entirely, replacing it with the vaguer ""difficult parts of living in America."" The phrase ""goes wrong"" is less specific than the original's ""ruined."" Contains redundant phrasing with ""special and amazing.""

Strengths: Uses very simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for B1 level. Successfully conveys the main message about increasing protected areas from 3% to 10%. Maintains the urgency of the original message.

Weaknesses: Loses some important details like ""marine protected areas"" becomes just ""protected sea areas."" The phrase ""dead coral"" is inaccurate - the coral is bleached, not dead. Omits the specific mention of the Red Sea location. The translation is somewhat oversimplified, potentially losing nuance.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains good balance between simplicity and detail retention. Accurately explains coral bleaching as ""turned white because the water is getting warmer."" Preserves the Red Sea reference and the desert metaphor. Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary while keeping sentences manageable. Maintains the original's structure and flow well.

Weaknesses: Uses ""swimming trips"" instead of ""expeditions,"" which slightly changes the context from scientific/environmental work to recreational activity. Minor loss of formality compared to the original.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains the technical term ""marine protected areas"" which shows good vocabulary preservation. Accurately describes coral bleaching as losing color due to warm water. Maintains the Red Sea reference and desert comparison. Preserves the scientific context with ""travels to different places"" instead of trivializing the expeditions.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""travels to different places"" is less specific than ""expeditions"" and doesn't fully capture the purposeful nature of Lewis's work. Some sentences could be slightly complex for B1 level learners.

**Overall Assessment:**
Model 2 provides the most balanced approach to B1 translation, maintaining accuracy while using appropriately simple language. Model 3 preserves more technical vocabulary but may be slightly challenging for B1 level. Model 1, while very accessible, sacrifices too much accuracy and detail.

Strengths: Successfully simplifies complex vocabulary while maintaining the core message. Reduces sentence complexity appropriately for B1 level. Preserves the main arguments clearly.

Weaknesses: Omits ""Enlightenment values"" entirely, which removes important context. ""Fatalism"" is completely dropped. ""Commentators and demagogues"" becomes just ""people,"" losing specificity about who is causing the problem. ""Irreparable damage"" is simplified to just ""damaging,"" reducing the severity of the warning.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains ""Enlightenment values"" and provides helpful explanation of the Enlightenment period. Simplifies ""commentators and demagogues"" to more accessible ""TV presenters and political leaders."" Maintains the concept of fatalism through ""feel hopeless.""

Weaknesses: Adds explanatory content that wasn't in the original text. The Enlightenment explanation, while helpful, represents additional information rather than translation. Some phrases become longer rather than simpler.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides clear explanations within parentheses for ""reason (thinking clearly)."" Maintains all key concepts including fatalism through ""believe nothing can change."" Preserves the severity with ""seriously damaging."" Keeps the global scope with ""around the world.""

Weaknesses: The parenthetical explanation interrupts reading flow. ""Commentators and demagogues"" becomes generic ""people who comment on news and political leaders,"" which is wordier. Some sentences become more complex rather than simpler.

Strengths: Maintains more of the original vocabulary while keeping it B1-appropriate (""main characters,"" ""realistic,"" ""hero""). Preserves the structure and flow of the original text well. Retains the phrase ""just as you are making the call"" which maintains the original's timing emphasis.
Weaknesses: Uses ""horror movies"" inconsistently with ""scary feeling"" - could have maintained ""scary movies"" throughout for consistency.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Good vocabulary choices for B1 level (""big trouble,"" ""exciting,"" ""run out""). Maintains the meaning effectively. Uses ""exactly when"" which emphasizes the timing aspect well.
Weaknesses: Changes ""suspense"" to ""exciting"" which alters the meaning slightly - suspense is more specific to the horror context. ""Run out"" for battery is appropriate but ""die"" might be more commonly understood in this context.

These are false ideas shown by TV and movies, but they may mean that girls don't connect with scientists and see science as an uninteresting career choice.

Strengths:
- Uses simple, clear vocabulary appropriate for B1 level
- Maintains all key information from the original text
- Sentence structure is straightforward and accessible
- Successfully conveys the main problems (cost, access, environmental impact)

Weaknesses:
- ""workers"" is less precise than ""staff"" for university context
- Some sentences are quite short, which may sound choppy
- Missing transitional words that could improve flow

**Model 2 Analysis:**

Strengths:
- Includes appropriate B1-level vocabulary while maintaining clarity
- Uses ""However"" as a transition word to introduce problems
- ""teachers"" is more specific and relatable than ""staff"" for B1 learners
- Adds helpful clarification with ""pick up a copy""
- Good balance between simplification and natural language flow

Weaknesses:
- ""really like"" adds emphasis not present in the original
- Slightly longer sentences may challenge some B1 learners

**Model 3 Analysis:**

Strengths:
- Identical content and structure to Model 2
- Same appropriate vocabulary choices and transitions
- Clear organization of information

Weaknesses:
- Identical to Model 2, offering no variation
- Same minor issues with added emphasis (""really like"")

**Comparison:**
Models 2 and 3 are identical translations. They both provide better flow and more natural language than Model 1, while maintaining B1-appropriate vocabulary. Model 1 uses simpler sentence structures but sacrifices some natural flow and precision. All three models successfully convey the essential information and maintain appropriate difficulty level for B1 learners.

Strengths:
- Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level
- Maintains the key statistical information (12% vs 7%)
- Conveys the main purpose of investigating workplace issues

Weaknesses:
- Oversimplifies ""employee engagement"" to just ""workers are not happy""
- Loses the formal tone of a business report
- Omits the connection between investigating causes and making recommendations
- Uses very basic vocabulary that may be below B1 level

**Model 2 Analysis:**

Strengths:
- Maintains appropriate B1 vocabulary level
- Preserves the formal structure and tone of the original
- Clearly explains the comparison with industry standards
- Maintains the logical flow from investigation to recommendations
- Uses ""percent"" spelling consistently

Weaknesses:
- Simplifies ""employee engagement"" to ""employees are not happy,"" missing the broader concept
- Could have retained some slightly more advanced vocabulary suitable for B1

**Model 3 Analysis:**

Strengths:
- Keeps the original ""per cent"" spelling, maintaining consistency with the source
- Preserves the main message and structure
- Uses appropriate B1-level language
- Maintains the cause-and-effect relationship between investigation and recommendations

Weaknesses:
- Also reduces ""employee engagement"" to just unhappiness
- The phrase ""so that more employees will want to stay"" is slightly awkward
- Mixes ""per cent"" and ""seven per cent"" inconsistently with numbers

All three translations successfully simplify complex business language for B1 level readers while maintaining the core message. However, all fail to adequately convey the concept of ""employee engagement,"" reducing it to simple unhappiness. Model 2 provides the most natural flow and maintains professional tone while being accessible. Model 3 preserves more of the original's formal elements but has minor consistency issues. Model 1, while clear, oversimplifies to a degree that may not challenge B1 learners appropriately.

I don't think this is such an issue for my generation who've lived without technology for so long. We know how to be alone and, more importantly, we know that it's OK to be alone. But the under 20s are another kettle of fish. They're so busy communicating that they never experience the feeling of solitude and run the risk of not learning how to enjoy their own company. In addition, they're learning conversation through messages that can be edited and changed at the expense of learning the art of real conversation in real time with the person in front of you.",claude-sonnet-4,"I agree with what the speaker said.

This means they're not learning how to have real conversations with real people face to face, where you have to speak immediately without being able to change what you say.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and sentence structures appropriate for B1 level. Successfully conveys the main ideas about technology creating isolation and generational differences. The phrase ""always communicate with their phones"" clearly explains the concept.

Weaknesses: Loses the idiomatic expression ""another kettle of fish"" without replacement. The opening ""I agree with"" changes the nuance from ""rang true."" Omits the concept of ""real time"" conversation, which is important to the original meaning.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the original opening structure while simplifying it appropriately. Preserves the phrase ""more importantly"" and explains the online connection aspect clearly. Includes the face-to-face conversation concept and maintains logical flow.

Weaknesses: Replaces ""another kettle of fish"" with ""completely different,"" losing the idiomatic flavor. The phrase ""sending messages"" is somewhat repetitive and doesn't fully capture the broader communication methods mentioned in the original.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides the most comprehensive explanation of concepts, particularly the final sentence about immediate speech without editing capability. Maintains the contrast between edited messages and real-time conversation effectively. Uses ""people my age"" which preserves the personal perspective.

Weaknesses: Uses ""I really agreed"" instead of preserving the present tense feeling of ""rang true."" Some sentences become lengthy for B1 level, particularly the final sentence. The phrase ""feel what it's like to be alone"" is slightly awkward compared to ""experience solitude.""

**Overall Assessment:**
Model 1 achieves the clearest simplification but sacrifices some meaning. Model 2 balances simplification with meaning preservation reasonably well. Model 3 provides the most complete explanation of concepts but may be slightly complex for B1 level in places.

When good and bad comments always come together, people stop believing the good comments and ignore them. Make sure you sometimes give positive feedback by itself, and don't always feel you need to add criticism or suggestions for improvement.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for B1 level (""good/bad feedback,"" ""stop believing""). The message is clear and concise.
Weaknesses: Loses some nuance from the original text. ""Devalued"" becomes simply ""stop believing,"" which doesn't fully capture the concept. The final sentence is quite abrupt and doesn't include the idea of ""constructive criticism"" or ""temptation to offer.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains good B1-level vocabulary while preserving more detail from the original. Includes the concept of ""mixing"" feedback and adds ""suggestions for improvement"" which helps explain what criticism means. The phrase ""don't always feel you need to"" captures the ""resist the temptation"" concept well.
Weaknesses: Slightly longer sentences that may approach B2 complexity. The structure is somewhat repetitive with ""always"" appearing frequently.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Successfully combines simple B1 vocabulary with comprehensive coverage of the original meaning. Includes both ""stop believing"" and ""ignore them,"" which better represents ""devalued and ignored."" The phrase ""make sure you sometimes"" effectively translates ""ensure there are times when."" Maintains the full meaning about resisting temptation to add criticism.
Weaknesses: The sentence structure is slightly more complex, though still within B1 range.

All three translations successfully adapt the text to B1 level by replacing complex terms like ""constructive criticism"" with simpler alternatives and using more direct sentence structures. Model 3 provides the most complete translation while maintaining appropriate language level, followed by Model 2 which includes helpful explanatory details, and Model 1 which, while clear, omits some important nuances.
