But to understand what they really mean for you, think about what is happening in your life and how you feel every day.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple, clear vocabulary appropriate for B1 level. The sentence structure is straightforward and easy to follow. Successfully conveys the main ideas without unnecessary complexity.

Weaknesses: Loses some nuance from the original text, particularly the phrase ""insights into things"" which becomes simply ""thoughts."" The connection between dreams and daily life is simplified to just ""what's happening in your life and how you feel,"" missing the ""events and feelings"" distinction.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains good B1-level vocabulary while preserving more of the original meaning. Uses appropriate punctuation with dashes to separate the dream examples clearly. Includes ""each day"" which maintains the daily life connection from the original.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""show you thoughts"" is slightly awkward grammatically - ""show you"" typically requires ""that"" or a different construction. The overall structure closely mirrors the original but could be more natural for B1 learners.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses ""might tell you"" which preserves the tentative tone of the original ""might show you."" Includes ""really mean"" which adds emphasis that helps clarify the concept. Maintains the daily life connection with ""every day.""

Weaknesses: Similar grammatical issue with ""tell you about thoughts you didn't know you had"" - the construction is somewhat awkward. The phrase ""every day"" might be slightly more complex than necessary for the context.

**Overall Comparison:**
All three translations successfully adapt the text to B1 level by simplifying vocabulary and sentence structure. Model 1 provides the clearest and most natural-sounding text but sacrifices some meaning. Models 2 and 3 preserve more of the original content but have minor grammatical awkwardness. Model 3 maintains the most faithful tone to the original while remaining accessible.

Strengths: Uses simpler vocabulary (""examples"" instead of ""cases"", ""groups"" instead of ""packs"") and maintains clear sentence structure. The contraction ""it's"" makes the text more conversational and accessible for B1 learners.
Weaknesses: Changes ""cases"" to ""examples"" which slightly alters the original meaning. The phrase ""cross the street with people"" is somewhat ambiguous and could be clearer.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains good vocabulary simplification and adds ""there"" for clarity about location. Uses ""these dogs"" for better reference continuity. Preserves the essential meaning while keeping language accessible.
Weaknesses: The tense inconsistency with ""are pets that their owners left"" (present tense ""are"" with past action ""left"") creates grammatical confusion. The phrase ""cross the street with people"" remains ambiguous.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides the clearest explanation by defining ""packs"" as ""groups called packs,"" which helps B1 learners understand the terminology. Clarifies the street-crossing behavior with ""when people are crossing"" rather than the ambiguous ""with people."" Maintains more formal structure with ""that they have"" instead of contractions.
Weaknesses: Slightly more complex sentence structure in some places, though still appropriate for B1 level.

**Overall Comparison:**
All three models successfully simplify vocabulary and maintain readability for B1 learners. Model 3 provides the most educational value by explaining terminology and clarifying meaning. Model 2 has a grammatical inconsistency that could confuse learners. Model 1 is the most concise but sacrifices some clarity.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary and sentence structures appropriate for B1 level. Changes ""New Yorker"" to ""She is from New York"" which clarifies the meaning. Simplifies ""facial deformities"" to ""facial differences.""

Weaknesses: Loses the specific detail ""one day"" from the original. Changes ""novel"" to ""book"" which is less precise. The phrase ""has been very popular"" is less specific than ""bestseller.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the term ""New Yorker"" while keeping it accessible. Uses ""became very popular"" which shows past action clearly. Adds ""often"" to describe school usage, making the frequency clearer. Specifies ""movie based on the book"" for clarity.

Weaknesses: Omits ""one day"" from the original text. Uses ""became"" instead of ""has been"" which changes the time reference slightly.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains ""one day"" from the original text. Uses ""start talks"" as a simpler alternative to ""starting point for discussions."" Adapts ""what it's like to be different"" to ""how it feels to be different"" using simpler language structure. Specifies ""movie based on the book.""

Weaknesses: The phrase ""start talks"" is somewhat awkward compared to natural B1 expressions.

**Overall Comparison:**
All three models successfully simplify ""facial deformities"" to ""facial differences"" and maintain the core meaning. Model 1 provides the clearest explanation of ""New Yorker"" but loses some details. Model 2 flows most naturally while maintaining key information.

Strengths: Maintains clear B1-appropriate vocabulary throughout. Preserves the logical flow of the original text. Uses ""named"" to clarify the rats' identities, which aids comprehension. The phrase ""for herself"" adds clarity about who wanted the rats.
Weaknesses: Completely omits the concept of ""lost count of the times,"" replacing it with the vaguer ""many times."" Some repetition in sentence structure could be improved.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for B1 level (""hurt"" instead of ""injured,"" ""drive out"" instead of ""chase""). Maintains the core meaning while simplifying sentence structures.
Weaknesses: Loses some specificity by omitting ""as they played"" when describing the electrocution context. Changes ""city council"" to just ""city,"" removing institutional detail. The phrase ""helped a little"" is somewhat vague compared to ""had some success.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains more detail from the original, including the playing context for electrocution. Preserves ""endangered species"" terminology. Uses clear B1-appropriate vocabulary while maintaining accuracy.
Weaknesses: Could be slightly more explicit about the meaning of ""endangered species"" for B1 learners. The sentence structure remains relatively complex in some parts.

Strengths: Maintains clear sentence structure and preserves the main ideas accurately. Uses appropriate B1-level vocabulary while keeping the original meaning intact. The flow between sentences is natural and coherent.

Weaknesses: Does not simplify potentially challenging vocabulary like ""inequality"" and ""discrimination"" for B1 learners. The phrase ""stayed popular"" slightly changes the original meaning of ""continued.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful explanations for difficult terms (""inequality"" and ""discrimination"") which supports B1 comprehension. Uses clear, accessible language throughout. Adds ""painted"" which makes the activity more concrete for learners.

Weaknesses: The explanations in parentheses interrupt the text flow and may appear overly pedagogical. Some additions like ""very quickly"" and ""important issues"" are not present in the original text.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Simplifies ""inequality"" to ""unfair treatment"" which is more accessible for B1 level. Uses ""dull"" instead of ""grey"" to add variety. Maintains good sentence structure and readability.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for B1 level (""shop displays,"" ""shoppers,"" ""big brands""). Sentence structure is clear and straightforward. Successfully simplifies ""bombard"" to ""show.""

Weaknesses: Loses the intensity of ""bombard"" which conveys the overwhelming nature of advertising. ""Shop displays"" changes the meaning from ""shop windows."" Omits ""British consumers"" specificity, using just ""British shoppers."" Doesn't include the disposable concept explicitly.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains ""shop windows"" from the original. Includes ""In the UK"" to preserve geographical reference. Adds ""thinking carefully"" which clarifies the concept. Explicitly mentions ""disposable"" to preserve the original meaning. Retains the specific ""two or three times"" detail.

Weaknesses: Uses ""many things"" which is less precise than the original's implication of constant bombardment. Slightly longer sentences may challenge some B1 learners.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Preserves ""shop windows"" accurately. Uses ""In the UK"" for clear geographical reference. Maintains the ""two or three times"" specific detail. ""Single-use items"" effectively conveys the disposable concept.

Weaknesses: Adds ""new things"" which wasn't in the original text. ""Thinking too much"" is less precise than ""without thinking."" ""Single-use items"" may be more complex vocabulary for B1 level compared to ""disposable.""

**Ranking Analysis:**
Model 2 maintains the most accurate content while using appropriate B1 vocabulary. It preserves key details like ""shop windows,"" geographical specificity, the disposable concept, and specific usage frequency.

Weaknesses: Loses some descriptive detail from the original, such as ""kicked and flicked"" becoming just ""swished."" The phrase ""countries on a map"" is less specific than the original ""shapes in an atlas."" Some nuance is lost in the final sentence about indoor work.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains more original details like ""kicked their legs and swished their tails."" Clearly explains the ten-month absence. Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary throughout. The explanation ""while others did the physical jobs"" adds helpful clarity.

Weaknesses: Adds ""stood and waited"" which wasn't in the original. The sentence structure becomes slightly choppy with the added explanation about the ten-month visit. Some sentences are longer than typical B1 level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains most original details effectively. Uses clear, simple language appropriate for B1 level. The sentence ""It was his first visit in ten months"" provides good clarity. Vocabulary choices are consistently accessible.

Weaknesses: Also adds ""stood and waited"" unnecessarily. The phrase ""wet marks"" is less natural than ""wet spots"" or ""damp patches."" Minor inconsistency in verb tense with ""works"" instead of ""worked"" in the final sentence.

Weaknesses: Omits ""wild"" when referring to pigs, which could cause confusion about the type of animals. Uses ""the city"" instead of specifying ""city council"" or ""city government,"" making it less precise. The metaphor ""losing battle"" is completely removed rather than simplified.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes ""wild pigs"" which provides important context missing in Model 1. Uses ""city government"" which is more specific than just ""the city."" Maintains all key information from the original text. Language remains accessible for B1 learners.

Weaknesses: Uses ""control the pigs"" which slightly changes the meaning from the original concept of a ""losing battle."" The phrasing is sometimes slightly more complex than necessary for B1 level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes ""wild pigs"" for clarity. Preserves ""city council"" from the original text, maintaining accuracy. Uses ""calmer way"" which effectively simplifies ""more peaceful action."" Attempts to maintain the ""losing battle"" metaphor with ""hard to win this fight.""

Weaknesses: ""Calmer way"" is less natural than ""peaceful way."" The phrase ""win this fight"" somewhat changes the nuance of the original metaphor, though it does preserve the concept better than Model 1.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three models successfully adapt the text to B1 level vocabulary and sentence structure. Model 2 provides the most complete and accurate information transfer while maintaining appropriate language complexity. Model 3 makes a good attempt to preserve the original metaphor but uses less natural phrasing. Model 1 is the simplest but loses some important details and context.

Strengths: Uses clear, simple vocabulary appropriate for B1 level (""myths"" instead of ""mythology,"" ""makes them send"" instead of ""forces""). Maintains the core meaning while simplifying complex structures. The phrase ""killed by a monster"" is more direct than ""eaten by.""

Weaknesses: Loses the specific detail about the labyrinth by only using ""maze."" Changes ""futuristic Theseus"" to ""modern version,"" which slightly alters the original meaning. Omits that the monster ""lives there.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Effectively uses ""big inspiration"" for accessibility. Includes both ""maze"" and ""labyrinth"" which helps B1 learners understand the concept. Uses italics appropriately for titles. Maintains the narrative flow well with ""But one boy, Theseus.""

Weaknesses: Changes ""classical Greek mythology"" to just ""Greek myths,"" losing some specificity. The phrase ""where a monster named the Minotaur kills them"" is slightly awkward. Also changes ""futuristic"" to ""modern.""

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains both ""modern"" and ""futuristic"" from the original, preserving the complete meaning. Clearly explains the labyrinth concept with ""maze called the labyrinth."" Uses accessible language while maintaining accuracy.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""where a monster named the Minotaur lives and kills them"" is somewhat lengthy for B1 level. ""Love for Greek myths"" is slightly less natural than ""love of Greek myths.""

**Ranking Assessment:**
Model 3 preserves the most original meaning while maintaining B1 accessibility, particularly keeping ""futuristic"" which is important to the author's intent. Model 2 provides good structural clarity and helpful formatting. Model 1 offers the simplest language but loses some key details.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level. Successfully simplifies ""conservation issues"" to ""protecting animals and their homes."" Maintains the core meaning of the original text.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""bringing them together with animals"" is awkward and unclear. ""Animal diseases"" is less precise than the original ""illnesses"" and changes the meaning slightly.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Clear and concise language suitable for B1 level. ""Protecting animals and nature"" effectively captures the conservation concept. The sentence structure flows well and maintains readability.

Weaknesses: Loses the specific mention that these were pets before being abandoned. ""Close to animals"" is somewhat vague compared to the original meaning of bringing people and animals together in an educational context.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains more detail from the original text, including the inspirational aspect of zoos. Clearly explains the pet abandonment situation. Maintains the research scope with ""things like"" which preserves the original's ""subjects like.""

Weaknesses: Slightly longer and more complex than typical B1 simplification. Some phrases like ""care about conservation"" might be challenging for B1 learners, though ""conservation"" is explained contextually.

Strengths: Maintains clear, concise language appropriate for B1 level. Uses simple vocabulary like ""growing,"" ""spread,"" and ""heavy spending."" Preserves the main ideas effectively.
Weaknesses: Omits ""various types of protests,"" making the protest description less complete. The phrase ""share and repair things"" is slightly less precise than the original's ""exchange and repair.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides helpful explanations like defining consumerism and explaining Black Friday/Cyber Monday context. Uses very accessible vocabulary. Adds clarifying details that aid B1 comprehension.
Weaknesses: Significantly longer than the original, which may not align with typical B1 text length expectations. The added explanations, while helpful, change the text's structure and flow considerably.

Strengths: Maintains the original meaning accurately while using appropriate B1-level vocabulary. The phrase ""how you see it"" effectively simplifies ""your point of view."" Uses ""fines"" correctly, which is appropriate vocabulary for B1 learners to encounter.

Weaknesses: ""City councils"" is changed to ""city governments,"" which alters the specific governmental body referenced in the original text.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Simplifies ""your point of view"" to ""what you think,"" which is very accessible for B1 learners. The phrase ""pay money as punishment"" clearly explains the concept of fines in simpler terms. Restructures the final sentence to make it more straightforward.

Weaknesses: Changes ""city councils"" to ""city governments,"" altering the original reference. The phrase ""pay money as punishment"" is somewhat awkward and less natural than using ""fines.""

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses ""how you see it"" as an effective simplification. Maintains ""the police"" with the article, staying closer to the original. Explains fines as ""pay money as a punishment"" for clarity. The final sentence structure is clear and emphasizes the cost aspect well.

Weaknesses: Changes ""city councils"" to ""city governments."" The phrase ""pay money as a punishment"" is less natural than the standard term ""fines."" Adds ""a lot of money"" instead of just ""a lot,"" which is slightly redundant.

When he discovers Princess Leia’s message inside the robot R2D2, meant for Obi-Wan Kenobi, it becomes “the call to adventure” — the moment that begins the hero’s journey.","**Model 1 Feedback:**

Strengths:
- Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level
- Maintains the core narrative structure
- Simplifies ""directly base"" to ""use"" effectively
- Preserves the key concept of ""the call to adventure""

Weaknesses:
- Omits ""that changes everything"" which is important context

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level. Successfully simplifies ""PHA"" to ""dangerous asteroid"" and maintains the core meaning. The sentence structure is straightforward and accessible.

Weaknesses: Omits the full acronym expansion for HAMMER, which reduces informational completeness. The phrase ""sounds like a movie plot"" loses some nuance from the original's ""may sound like.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains complete information by including the full HAMMER acronym expansion. Uses appropriate B1-level vocabulary while preserving technical accuracy. The phrase ""might sound like"" better reflects the original's tentative tone. Clear logical flow between sentences.

Weaknesses: Slightly longer sentences due to the acronym inclusion, though still within B1 comprehension range.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes the full HAMMER acronym expansion. Uses simple vocabulary with ""movie story"" instead of ""movie plot."" Maintains clear sentence structure throughout.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""there is also a real plan"" creates awkward phrasing compared to the more natural ""it's also part of a real NASA plan."" The connection between the movie reference and the real plan feels less smooth due to this construction.

All three translations successfully adapt the technical content for B1 level by simplifying ""PHA"" and maintaining accessible vocabulary. They preserve the essential information about the dual approach (deflection vs. destruction) and the NASA connection.

Strengths: Maintains the original structure well and preserves key terminology like ""cross the threshold"" and ""special world"" in quotation marks. The sentence flow is natural and the meaning remains clear.
Weaknesses: The phrase ""all inside the special world of the Death Star"" at the end creates slight ambiguity about whether all characters exist only within the Death Star, which differs from the original meaning.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides clear temporal markers with ""After that"" and ""In this world"" which improve readability for B1 learners. Maintains the original meaning accurately and preserves important terminology. The final sentence clearly separates the location from the character descriptions.
Weaknesses: Slightly more verbose than necessary with the addition of transitional phrases.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Adds helpful explanatory text (""called a mentor"" and ""a new, dangerous place"") which aids B1 comprehension. Maintains clear structure and accurate meaning.
Weaknesses: Removes the quotation marks around ""cross the threshold,"" replacing it with simpler language that loses some of the original's technical terminology. The addition of ""dangerous"" adds interpretation not present in the original text.

**Ranking Assessment:**
Model 2 maintains the most faithful translation while adding appropriate B1-level structural support. Model 1 preserves terminology well but has minor clarity issues. Model 3 provides good explanatory support but takes more liberties with the original content and terminology.

Strengths: Uses clear, simple vocabulary appropriate for B1 level. The phrase ""directly to each other"" effectively captures peer-to-peer sharing. Maintains good flow and readability.
Weaknesses: Omits the concept of ""communities"" from the original text. The phrase ""through websites and social media"" is less specific than the original's mention of groups that facilitate transactions.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes the important detail about ""social media groups"" which preserves the community aspect. Uses ""helpful"" which is simpler than ""valuable"" for B1 learners. Maintains the facilitating function of these platforms.
Weaknesses: The phrase ""share things directly with each other"" is somewhat redundant with ""directly."" Could be more concise.

Strengths: Uses simpler vocabulary (""show"" instead of ""represent,"" ""emotions"" instead of ""feelings""), maintains clear sentence structure, and effectively condenses complex ideas. The flow between sentences is smooth.
Weaknesses: Loses some specificity by changing ""things we see in our dreams"" to just ""dreams,"" and omits the conditional structure ""if we understand"" in favor of ""by understanding.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains more precision from the original by keeping ""things we see in dreams"" and uses appropriate B1-level vocabulary with ""stand for"" replacing ""represent."" Maintains the logical flow between contrasting theories.
Weaknesses: Uses ""emotions and problems"" instead of ""emotions and the problems they cause,"" which slightly changes the meaning and loses the causal relationship.

Strengths: Maintains technical accuracy while simplifying vocabulary appropriately. Uses ""funds"" instead of ""money"" which adds slight variety. Preserves the conditional structure and timeline clearly. The phrase ""spot asteroids"" is accessible for B1 learners.

Weaknesses: ""About ten years"" changes the meaning slightly from ""in ten years."" The explanation of PHAs could be clearer for B1 learners who may not understand the distinction being made.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides the clearest explanation by breaking down NEOCam into two sentences, making it easier to follow. Adds helpful clarification ""which could actually hit our planet"" that makes the danger more explicit for B1 learners. Uses simple, direct language throughout.

Weaknesses: The addition of explanatory text, while helpful, deviates from the original content. ""Finish the job"" is more colloquial than necessary and slightly changes the tone.

Strengths: Uses simple, accessible vocabulary appropriate for B1 level. The sentence ""But you might still want some dreams where your mind shares hidden thoughts!"" effectively simplifies the complex concept of subconscious processing.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""can even control what happens"" is somewhat vague compared to the original's more specific ""make decisions to affect the events."" The explanation lacks some precision in describing the lucid dreaming process.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains clear, B1-appropriate language throughout. The phrase ""you can choose what happens"" directly translates the decision-making aspect well. The explanation of normal dreams helping the mind ""show you what you're thinking or feeling"" is clear and accessible.

Weaknesses: Uses ""normal dreams"" which slightly oversimplifies the original concept. The connection between dream journaling and lucid dreaming could be more explicit.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides the most complete translation while maintaining B1 vocabulary. The phrase ""make choices that change what happens in the dream"" closely mirrors the original's meaning. Uses ""unconscious mind"" which is more precise than other models' alternatives while remaining accessible.

Weaknesses: Slightly longer sentences may approach the upper limit of B1 complexity. The word ""unconscious"" might be marginally more challenging than necessary for B1 level.

A lot of the clothes charities can’t sell are sent to other countries, which creates more economic and environmental problems.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simpler vocabulary effectively (""throwaway"" for ""disposable,"" ""low quality"" for ""poor quality""). Maintains the core message while being concise. The phrase ""end up in the trash"" is clear and accessible.

Weaknesses: ""Old clothes"" doesn't capture ""unwanted clothes"" precisely - clothes can be unwanted without being old. ""Other countries"" is less specific than ""abroad."" Some nuance is lost in the simplification.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Adds helpful connective phrases like ""As a result"" that improve flow and comprehension. ""They receive"" clarifies the relationship between charity shops and donated clothes. Maintains most of the original meaning while using B1-appropriate vocabulary.

Weaknesses: ""Be reused or recycled"" is slightly more complex than necessary. The structure closely mirrors the original, which may not optimize readability for B1 learners.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses ""unpopular"" instead of technical fashion terminology, making it more accessible. ""Made from low-quality material"" provides clearer explanation than the original. Good use of connecting phrases and maintains logical flow.

Weaknesses: ""So it's hard to recycle"" adds an interpretation not explicitly stated in the original. The explanation becomes slightly longer, which may reduce conciseness expected at B1 level.

**Ranking Analysis:**
Model 2 provides the most balanced approach with clear connections between ideas and appropriate vocabulary simplification. Model 3 offers good explanations but adds interpretive elements. Model 1 is concise but loses some precision in meaning.

Strengths: Maintains clear, simple sentence structure appropriate for B1 level. Uses accessible vocabulary like ""quit"" instead of ""given up"" and ""saved"" instead of ""rescued."" Preserves all key information from the original text.
Weaknesses: The opening sentence loses some nuance by omitting the continuation aspect (""go from challenge to challenge""). Uses ""amazing"" which may be slightly advanced for B1 level.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Effectively captures the continuation concept with ""they keep taking on new challenges."" Adds helpful clarification with ""Meagan McGrath from Canada is one of them."" Uses simple vocabulary and clear sentence breaks. Maintains the uncertainty with ""maybe her most amazing trip.""
Weaknesses: The dash usage in the first sentence may be unnecessary punctuation for B1 level. Slightly longer sentences in some places.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides excellent clarification by explaining ""glacier"" as ""deep crack in the ice,"" which aids B1 comprehension. Uses ""sled"" instead of ""sledge,"" which is more familiar vocabulary. Maintains appropriate sentence length and structure.
Weaknesses: Changes ""perhaps"" to ""might be,"" which slightly alters the meaning. The explanation of glacier, while helpful, adds words that weren't in the original.

All three models successfully simplify vocabulary (rescued→saved, given up→quit/stopped) and break down complex sentences. They maintain factual accuracy and preserve the narrative flow.

Today, he uses his art to make people think about social problems. He paints images of homeless people in cities to help residents notice and think about homelessness.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains all key information from the original text. Uses appropriate B1-level vocabulary with ""began"" instead of ""started out"" and ""hometown"" instead of ""home city."" The phrase ""help residents notice and think about"" effectively simplifies ""encourage residents to think about"" while preserving meaning.

Weaknesses: Removes ""big cities"" and changes it to just ""cities,"" which slightly reduces the emphasis on urban scale that was present in the original.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes all essential information and adds ""For example"" to create better text flow and clarity. Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary. Maintains ""big cities"" from the original text. The addition of the transition phrase helps readers understand the connection between the general statement and specific example.

Weaknesses: The addition of ""For example"" slightly changes the structure from the original, though this change improves readability.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Preserves most key information and uses suitable B1-level vocabulary. Uses ""images"" instead of ""pictures,"" which provides vocabulary variation while maintaining meaning.

Weaknesses: Removes ""big cities"" and uses only ""cities,"" reducing the emphasis on urban scale. The word choice is less varied compared to other models.

**Overall Comparison:**
All three models successfully adapt the text to B1 level by simplifying ""started out"" to ""began,"" ""home city"" to ""hometown,"" and ""encourage"" to ""help.""

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level. Maintains the core message and examples effectively. The sentence structure is straightforward and accessible.

Weaknesses: Loses the nuance of ""encourage artists not to paint graffiti randomly"" by simplifying to ""let artists paint graffiti in special areas instead."" The word ""councils"" is simplified to ""places"" in the opening, which removes some specificity. The phrase ""the city even allows"" slightly changes the emphasis from the original ""city council has even allowed.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Preserves the original meaning most accurately, including the concept of encouraging artists to stop random graffiti. Adds helpful clarification ""without getting in trouble"" which aids B1 comprehension. Maintains the distinction between different types of government bodies.

Weaknesses: Uses ""local governments"" twice, which could be varied for better style. The sentence structure is slightly more complex, which may challenge some B1 learners. Some phrases like ""encouraged artists to stop painting"" are somewhat wordy.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses clear, simple language suitable for B1 level. Effectively conveys the main concept of providing alternatives to random graffiti. Good use of examples to illustrate the point.

Weaknesses: Changes ""encourage artists not to paint graffiti randomly"" to ""tried to stop random graffiti,"" which shifts focus from artist encouragement to graffiti prevention. This changes the original tone and emphasis. The meaning is somewhat altered by this rephrasing.

Strengths: Maintains clear sentence structure and preserves the main ideas. Uses appropriate B1-level vocabulary like ""washed away"" and ""always changing."" The flow between sentences is natural.

Weaknesses: ""Paints large, colourful pictures"" is less precise than ""makes paintings."" The phrase ""cleaned by the city"" loses some specificity compared to the original ""cleaners from the city council.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses ""makes large, colourful paintings"" which is more accurate than ""pictures."" Includes weather elements (rain, wind) that add detail. The dash usage creates clear emphasis. ""New starts"" is simpler than ""new beginnings"" for B1 level.

Weaknesses: The sentence structure is sometimes choppy due to the dash usage, which may affect readability flow.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Most comprehensive translation that includes weather factors (rain, wind). Uses ""old, unused cars"" which clarifies ""abandoned cars"" effectively for B1 learners. The final phrase ""things ending and new things beginning"" uses very accessible vocabulary.

Strengths: Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary and maintains clear sentence structure. Successfully simplifies ""high power distance culture"" to ""culture where authority is respected."" The phrase ""welcome feedback or challenges"" effectively captures the original meaning.

Weaknesses: ""Without questioning them"" is slightly stronger than the original's ""not often challenged."" The transition with ""however"" could be smoother, and some nuance about the cultural concept is lost.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Excellent use of B1-appropriate language with ""knew their role"" and ""rarely questioned."" The contrast between cultures is clearly presented. ""Share their opinions, even if they disagree"" effectively conveys the challenging aspect while remaining accessible.

Weaknesses: ""Different style"" is somewhat vague compared to explaining it as a contrasting cultural approach. The sentence ""There, leaders act more like coaches..."" could flow better with the previous sentence.

Scientists hope this change will be big enough for telescopes on Earth to see.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the technical acronym explanation, uses appropriate B1 vocabulary like ""orbits"" and ""telescopes,"" and preserves the key scientific concepts. The sentence structure is clear and accessible.
Weaknesses: The phrase ""hit it hard enough"" is somewhat informal for scientific content. The translation loses some specificity from the original phrase ""knock it out of its orbit enough.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simpler vocabulary with ""goes around"" instead of ""orbits,"" which is more accessible for B1 learners. Provides clear explanation of the mission's goal and breaks down complex ideas into digestible parts. The phrase ""change its path slightly"" effectively simplifies the concept.
Weaknesses: Uses ""across"" for the asteroid's measurement, which may be less precise than ""wide."" The sentence structure becomes somewhat repetitive with multiple short sentences.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses accessible language with ""goes around"" and maintains clarity throughout. The explanation is methodical and easy to follow. Consistently uses ""wide"" for measurements, maintaining parallel structure.
Weaknesses: The phrase ""change the moon's path a little"" uses very basic vocabulary that may oversimplify the scientific concept. The repetitive sentence structure could impact reading flow.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three models successfully adapt the content for B1 level by simplifying complex scientific concepts while retaining essential information. Model 2 provides the most balanced approach between accessibility and scientific accuracy. Model 1 maintains more technical language but remains comprehensible. Model 3 uses the simplest language but may oversimplify some concepts.

Strengths: Maintains formal vocabulary appropriately (""heroine,"" ""volunteers,"" ""tribute""). Uses clear sentence structures. Preserves the original meaning accurately.
Weaknesses: Retains some complex phrasing like ""finds herself in a complicated relationship"" which may be challenging for B1 learners.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simpler vocabulary substitutions (""main character"" instead of ""heroine,"" ""says she will go"" instead of ""volunteers,"" ""gets into"" instead of ""finds herself in""). Clear and direct language throughout.
Weaknesses: ""Gets into a complicated relationship"" creates ambiguity about whether the relationship is intentional or circumstantial, slightly altering the original meaning.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Combines accessible vocabulary (""main character,"" ""picked,"" ""chooses"") with clear explanations. ""Difficult and confusing relationship"" breaks down the concept of ""complicated"" into more concrete terms that B1 learners can understand.
Weaknesses: Slightly longer phrasing in the final sentence, though this serves the purpose of clarification.

**Comparison:**
All three models successfully simplify vocabulary and maintain readability. Model 1 stays closest to the original text but retains some challenging elements.

Strengths: Uses clear, simple sentence structures appropriate for B1 level. The phrase ""what's happening in your life and how you feel each day"" is accessible and well-structured. Maintains the original meaning while simplifying complex constructions.

Weaknesses: The dash usage may be slightly advanced for B1 learners. The transition ""Then"" changes the original timing indicated by ""Now.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Breaks down ""people and places"" into more explicit terms (""who was in the dream and where it took place""), which aids comprehension. Uses straightforward vocabulary throughout.

Weaknesses: The dash punctuation is less common at B1 level. Changes ""each day"" to ""how you're feeling,"" which is less specific than the original's reference to daily life.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains ""because"" instead of using dashes, which is more appropriate for B1 level. Preserves the original's ""Now"" for better temporal accuracy. The phrase ""everyday life"" effectively combines the original's ""daily life"" concept.

Weaknesses: ""Begin to see"" is slightly more formal than necessary. The sentence structure in the final part is somewhat complex for B1 level.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three models successfully simplify the original text while maintaining its core meaning. They appropriately reduce sentence complexity and use vocabulary suitable for B1 learners.

This was especially true for old train bridges, where sparks from the metal wheels and metal tracks could sometimes set the bridge on fire, burning it down completely.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level. Successfully conveys the main ideas about wooden bridges and fire risk. The sentence structure is straightforward and accessible.

Weaknesses: Loses the word ""sometimes"" which indicates frequency, making the fire risk seem more absolute than in the original. The phrase ""burn it down"" is slightly less formal than the original context suggests.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the comparative aspect with ""more easily."" Preserves the conditional nature with ""could sometimes."" Uses clear sentence breaks that aid comprehension. Includes ""completely"" which effectively conveys the total destruction meaning.

Weaknesses: Creates two separate sentences where the original had one complex sentence, which changes the flow slightly. The separation may make the connection between the general statement and specific example less clear.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains the comparative ""more easily"" and the frequency indicator ""sometimes."" Maintains the causal relationship in a single sentence structure. Includes ""completely"" for emphasis on total destruction. Preserves the logical flow of the original.

Weaknesses: The sentence structure, while clear, is quite long for B1 level and may challenge some learners.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three translations successfully adapt the vocabulary and concepts for B1 level. Model 1 uses the simplest language but omits important nuance. Model 2 breaks down complex ideas effectively but alters sentence structure significantly. Model 3 balances accessibility with fidelity to the original meaning and structure.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level. Maintains good flow and readability. Successfully simplifies ""legitimate art form"" to ""real form of art."" Preserves the main message and structure of the original.

Weaknesses: Changes ""travelling and working around the globe"" to just ""travelling the world to create art,"" losing the nuance of working globally. Uses ""Even though"" which may be slightly complex for B1 level.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains most of the original content accurately. Uses ""patterns are starting to appear"" which effectively simplifies ""trends are emerging."" Preserves the distinction between city and neighbourhood. Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary throughout.

Weaknesses: ""However"" appears twice in close succession, creating repetitive sentence structure. The phrase ""real and important form of art"" adds ""important"" which wasn't in the original text.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses ""we can see some new trends"" which is clear and direct for B1 level. Maintains good sentence variety. Preserves most key information from the original.

Weaknesses: Changes ""Other artists"" to ""Some artists,"" which alters the meaning by suggesting only some rather than additional artists use the internet. Uses ""online"" redundantly after already mentioning ""internet."" Like Model 2, adds ""important"" to describe the art form, which wasn't in the original.

Weaknesses: Changes ""liked"" to ""loved,"" which intensifies the emotion beyond the original. ""This part of the day"" is slightly less natural than ""this time of day.""

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the original emotional tone by keeping ""liked"" instead of changing to ""loved."" Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary while preserving the meaning. ""Became busy"" effectively simplifies ""filled up with.""
Weaknesses: Retains ""this part of the day"" which is slightly less natural than the original phrasing. Uses ""play with"" which may sound childish for a school-age student with homework.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three models successfully simplify the text to B1 level. Model 1 makes the most significant vocabulary changes but alters the tone. Model 2 provides the clearest language but changes emotional intensity. Model 3 best preserves the original tone while making appropriate simplifications.

Strengths: Maintains accurate information and uses appropriate B1-level vocabulary. The sentence structure is clear and accessible. Successfully preserves all key numerical data (90%, 1km, 50 million km, 887, 50).

Weaknesses: The phrase ""travel within 50 million kilometres"" slightly misrepresents the original meaning, which refers to orbital proximity rather than active movement through that space.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Adds helpful clarification by explaining ""Earth's path around the Sun"" instead of just ""Earth's orbit,"" making the concept more accessible to B1 learners. Uses ""space rocks"" as an additional explanatory term. Maintains factual accuracy and appropriate vocabulary level.

Weaknesses: Minor structural awkwardness in the opening phrase ""asteroids near Earth that are about 1km wide"" could be smoother.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides the clearest explanation with ""Earth's path around the Sun"" and uses ""space rocks"" for additional clarity. The sentence flow is smooth and natural. Maintains all factual information accurately. The vocabulary and sentence complexity are well-suited for B1 level.

Weaknesses: Very minor - could be considered slightly longer than necessary, but this doesn't significantly impact comprehension.

**Comparison:**
All three models successfully adapt the text to B1 level while preserving factual accuracy. The main differences lie in explanatory additions and clarity of expression. Models 2 and 3 provide better conceptual clarity by explaining ""orbit"" as ""path around the Sun."" Model 3 has the most natural sentence flow, while Model 2 has slight structural issues. Model 1, while accurate, provides less explanatory support for B1 learners.

Strengths: Uses clear, accessible vocabulary appropriate for B1 level. Maintains good flow and readability. Successfully conveys the main narrative points without losing meaning.
Weaknesses: Loses some emotional intensity from the original. ""Especially hard"" is less impactful than ""agonising experience."" The phrase ""as if he has a disease"" doesn't capture the specific reference to ""the plague"" that classmates use.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains the specific reference to ""the plague"" which is important context. Uses natural B1-level language while preserving key details. Good paragraph structure that maintains readability.
Weaknesses: The phrase ""hard feelings"" is imprecise - the original refers to difficult experiences, not emotions specifically. Some sentences could be more concise.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Direct and clear language suitable for B1 level. Maintains the emotional weight with phrases like ""difficult and emotional moments."" Clear cause-and-effect structure.
Weaknesses: ""Because of his face"" is more direct but less sensitive than ""appearance."" The phrase ""disease like the plague"" is slightly awkward and changes the meaning - the original suggests classmates call his condition ""the plague,"" not that they compare it to the historical plague.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three models successfully adapt the text to B1 level vocabulary and sentence structure. Model 2 preserves the most crucial details, including the specific ""plague"" reference. Model 1 provides the smoothest reading experience but loses some specificity. Model 3 maintains emotional impact but has some awkward phrasing and meaning changes.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level. ""Went on and on"" effectively conveys the vastness. Maintains the core meaning while simplifying complex structures.
Weaknesses: Omits the specific mention of the boy being ""bored and rebellious,"" losing some character detail. ""Pawing"" is less accurate than the original ""kicking.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains important character emotions (""bored or angry""). Uses accessible vocabulary while preserving most original details. ""Seemed to go on forever"" is clear and vivid. Maintains the contrast between skilled and unskilled riders effectively.
Weaknesses: Changes ""kicking"" to ""pawing,"" which alters the horse's behavior description. ""So far from help"" changes the nuance from ""so far from anyone.""

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Preserves the original verb ""kicking"" accurately. Maintains character emotions and the wondering tone. Keeps the phrase ""so far from anyone"" intact. Sentence structure remains close to the original while being accessible.
Weaknesses: ""Almost impossible to see"" is slightly more complex than necessary for B1 level. The final sentence structure is somewhat lengthy for the target level.

Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for B1 level (""cold weather"" instead of ""freezing conditions,"" ""top climbers"" instead of ""world's best climbers""). The sentence structure is clear and accessible.

Weaknesses: Changes ""climbers"" to ""people"" which loses the specific meaning that these were people who climbed. ""Cold weather"" is less precise than the original ""freezing conditions."" Uses ""After school"" instead of ""When she left school,"" which could be misunderstood as referring to daily after-school time rather than graduation.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains ""Mount Everest"" for clarity. Uses ""continued climbing"" which is more precise than ""kept climbing."" Correctly interprets ""When she left school"" as after finishing education. Preserves most of the original meaning while simplifying vocabulary.

Weaknesses: ""Very cold weather"" is slightly redundant. The phrase ""the world's best climbers"" could be simplified further for B1 level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses clear, simple vocabulary throughout. ""Best climbers"" is more B1-appropriate than ""world's best climbers."" Maintains the correct interpretation of ""When she left school."" Uses ""continued climbing"" appropriately.

Weaknesses: Adds ""very"" before ""high mountains"" which wasn't in the original. Like Model 2, uses ""very cold weather"" which is slightly redundant.

Strengths: Maintains the original sentence structure and flow well. Uses appropriate B1-level vocabulary substitutions like ""looked cool"" for ""trendy"" and ""storage space"" for ""storeroom."" Preserves the semicolon structure that connects the examples effectively.

Weaknesses: Omits ""tropical"" when describing the country, losing some descriptive detail. The phrase ""being used well"" is less precise than the original ""being put to good use.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Simplifies complex sentence structures into shorter, more manageable sentences appropriate for B1 level. Uses clear, accessible vocabulary throughout. Maintains all key examples and details, including ""tropical.""

Weaknesses: Changes the original punctuation structure by breaking the list into separate sentences, which alters the rhetorical flow. The transition from colon to separate examples disrupts the original's cohesive listing format.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level. The phrase ""giving them special knowledge"" effectively simplifies ""insight."" The structure flows naturally and maintains the original meaning.

Weaknesses: Omits ""Throughout history"" which loses some temporal emphasis from the original. The ending ""seeing it happen in real life"" is slightly less precise than the original's ""came true in real life.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains good B1-level vocabulary while preserving more of the original structure. Uses ""understanding"" as a clear equivalent for ""insight."" The phrase ""Even now"" provides good temporal contrast.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""meant to give them knowledge or understanding"" creates slight redundancy. The comma placement after ""long time"" creates an unnecessary pause that wasn't in the original.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Combines elements effectively by using both ""special knowledge"" and ""understanding."" The phrase ""remember a time when they dreamed"" closely mirrors the original structure. ""It really happened"" is a natural B1-level expression.

Weaknesses: The sentence becomes slightly longer and more complex with ""special knowledge or understanding,"" which may be less suitable for B1 level. The comma after ""long time"" creates the same unnecessary pause as Model 2.

Changes ""their territory"" to ""their area,"" which is simpler but less precise. The phrase ""ask for food"" may be too simplified as it doesn't capture the begging behavior as clearly.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains important details like ""Either way"" and ""from one area to another."" Uses ""underground trains"" as an alternative to ""metro system,"" which may be clearer for some B1 learners. Maintains the exclamation mark for emphasis. Clearly specifies ""the smaller dogs"" rather than just ""these dogs.""

Weaknesses: ""Underground trains"" is longer than necessary when ""metro"" or ""subway"" would suffice at B1 level. The phrase structure is occasionally more complex than needed for B1 level.

**Overall Comparison:**
All three models successfully adapt the text to B1 level by simplifying vocabulary and sentence structures. Model 1 provides the most consistent simplification, Model 2 uses the most natural B1 expressions, and Model 3 retains the most detail from the original text while still being accessible.

Strengths: Maintains the original sentence structure well, uses appropriate B1-level vocabulary substitutions (""whole length"" for ""length,"" ""dangerous animals"" for direct listing), and preserves the chronological flow of information.
Weaknesses: The phrase ""stayed safe and only got"" creates a slight contradiction since getting thousands of bites isn't entirely ""staying safe.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Restructures sentences effectively for B1 level by breaking complex information into shorter segments, uses simpler vocabulary consistently, and maintains factual accuracy.
Weaknesses: Changes ""always in danger"" to ""often in danger,"" which alters the intensity of the original meaning. The same contradiction exists between ""stayed safe"" and getting thousands of bites.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Preserves the original tense (""is the first person""), maintains sentence complexity appropriate for B1 level, uses effective vocabulary simplification, and keeps the temporal structure clear.
Weaknesses: Contains the same contradiction between ""stayed safe"" and receiving thousands of bites as the other models.

**Comparative Assessment:**
All three models successfully adapt vocabulary to B1 level and maintain factual accuracy. Model 2 shows the most significant content change by reducing ""constant danger"" to ""often in danger."" Model 1 maintains the closest structural similarity to the original. Model 3 preserves the original present tense while effectively simplifying language. All models struggle with the logical inconsistency in describing the outcome of Ed's journey.

Also, people are spending money they do not have to buy things they do not need. Britain throws away 300,000 tons of clothing every year. Most of this ends up in landfill sites (places where trash is buried).","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains clear, concise language appropriate for B1 level. Successfully preserves all key statistics and main arguments. Uses simpler vocabulary (""ends up in landfills"" instead of ""goes into landfill sites"") while retaining meaning. Good flow and readability.

Weaknesses: Changes ""more than £1,000"" to ""over £1,000"" which slightly alters the precision. Removes ""new"" from ""new clothes"" in the opening, losing a detail from the original.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Breaks down complex sentences effectively for B1 comprehension. Adds helpful clarification with ""Right now"" and uses ""serious problems"" which is clear vocabulary. Maintains all numerical data accurately. The phrase ""don't really need"" adds appropriate emphasis.

Weaknesses: Adds ""buried in"" before ""landfill sites"" which, while explanatory, changes the original phrasing. Some sentences become choppy due to over-simplification, potentially affecting natural flow.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Changes ""more than £1,000"" to ""about £1,000"" which uses simpler language. Replaces ""income"" with ""what they earn"" for better B1 accessibility. Provides explicit definition of landfill sites in parentheses, which aids comprehension. Maintains formal structure while simplifying vocabulary.

Weaknesses: The approximation ""about £1,000"" loses the precision of ""more than £1,000."" The parenthetical explanation, while helpful, interrupts sentence flow. Some word choices like ""This debt is"" create slightly awkward phrasing.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three models successfully adapt the text for B1 level by simplifying vocabulary and sentence structure while preserving the core message about British spending habits, credit card debt, and clothing waste. Model 1 maintains the best balance between simplification and natural flow. Model 2 provides good clarity but sometimes over-simplifies. Model 3 offers helpful explanations but makes some precision trade-offs.

Strengths:
- Maintains clear structure and logical flow
- Uses appropriate B1-level vocabulary (""realized,"" ""profitable,"" ""platforms"")
- Preserves the main concepts effectively
- Sentence length is appropriate for B1 level

Weaknesses:
- Omits the middleman concept, which is important for understanding the business model
- Loses some specificity by not mentioning ""accommodation"" or ""travelers/tourists""
- Slightly reduces the explanatory detail compared to the original

**Model 2 Analysis:**

Strengths:
- Retains most key information from the original text
- Uses clear, accessible language appropriate for B1 level
- Maintains the parallel structure with ""For example"" and ""Another example""
- Includes specific details like ""travelers"" which adds context

Weaknesses:
- Still omits the middleman concept
- Could have simplified ""profitable"" construction slightly more for B1 level
- The phrase ""not being used enough"" is somewhat awkward

**Model 3 Analysis:**

Strengths:
- Breaks down complex ideas into shorter, clearer sentences
- Explicitly mentions ""websites or apps"" which is more concrete than ""platforms""
- Uses ""tourists"" instead of generic terms, adding helpful specificity
- Sentence structure is well-suited for B1 comprehension level

Weaknesses:

When we are awake, we usually think in words, like having a conversation with ourselves. But when we sleep, the part of the brain that controls language becomes less active, and the part that controls feelings becomes more active.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simpler vocabulary with ""sorts out"" instead of ""organizes"" and ""handles"" instead of ""controls,"" which is more accessible for B1 learners. The sentence structure is clear and direct.
Weaknesses: ""Sorts out"" may be less precise than the original meaning. Removes ""usually"" which softens the generalization about thinking patterns.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains ""organizes"" from the original while keeping it accessible. Adds ""usually"" which appropriately qualifies the statement about thinking patterns. Uses ""feelings"" instead of ""emotions,"" which is simpler vocabulary. The phrase ""works less"" is more straightforward than ""becomes less active.""
Weaknesses: ""Works less"" is less precise than ""becomes less active"" and may sound too informal.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Preserves more elements from the original text, including ""we had during the day"" and ""having a conversation with ourselves."" Maintains ""controls"" which matches the original terminology. Includes ""usually"" for appropriate qualification.
Weaknesses: Uses ""controls"" twice, which may be more challenging vocabulary for B1 level. ""Having a conversation with ourselves"" is slightly more complex than ""talking to ourselves.""

**Comparison:**
All three models successfully simplify the original text while maintaining the core meaning. Model 1 uses the simplest vocabulary but loses some nuance. Model 2 balances simplification with accuracy effectively. Model 3 stays closest to the original but may be slightly more challenging for B1 learners due to vocabulary choices.

Strengths: Uses simpler vocabulary (e.g., ""really matters"" instead of ""all-important""), maintains clear structure, and preserves all key concepts. The sentence structure is appropriately simplified for B1 level.
Weaknesses: The phrase ""heart-to-heart"" is completely omitted without explanation, and some nuance is lost in simplification.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Adds helpful clarification with ""share your thoughts,"" uses ""often"" instead of ""regularly"" for simpler vocabulary, and explicitly mentions ""emotional connection"" which aids comprehension. Maintains good flow and readability.
Weaknesses: Slightly longer than necessary for B1 level, and the addition of ""emotional"" wasn't in the original text.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains more of the original phrasing while keeping it accessible, includes ""thoughts and feelings"" for clarity, and adds ""closer relationships"" at the end which reinforces the main message. Good balance between simplification and completeness.
Weaknesses: Uses ""hobbies"" which wasn't in the original text, and is the longest of the three versions, potentially making it less suitable for B1 learners.

**Overall Comparison:**
All three models successfully simplify vocabulary and sentence structure while maintaining the core message. Model 1 is the most concise but loses some detail. Model 2 provides good clarification but adds content not in the original. Model 3 maintains the most comprehensive coverage while staying accessible.

The main differences lie in how each handles the balance between simplification and completeness, with varying degrees of paraphrasing and explanation.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level. Successfully simplifies ""plasticity of the brain"" to ""brain can change and grow."" Maintains the core message about praising process over results. The sentence structure is straightforward and accessible.

Weaknesses: Loses some specificity from the original text. ""Experimentation"" is simplified to ""try new things"" which reduces precision. The phrase ""continued honing of talents"" is condensed to just ""learning new skills,"" missing the concept of improving existing abilities.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains good B1-level vocabulary while preserving more detail from the original. Uses ""studies"" instead of just ""research"" for variety. Includes the word ""process"" which directly connects to the original concept. The structure flows logically from concept to examples to application.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""how they try new ways"" is somewhat awkward phrasing. Could have been clearer about the distinction between developing new skills versus improving existing ones.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Preserves the original word ""organising"" from the example, maintaining consistency with the source text. Clearly explains both aspects of skill development - learning new skills and improving existing abilities. Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary throughout.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""keep improving what they can do"" is less precise than other translations. ""Trying new ways"" lacks the specificity of ""experimentation"" from the original text.

All three translations successfully adapt the text to B1 level by using simpler vocabulary and shorter sentences. They maintain the key concepts of growth mindset, brain plasticity, and the importance of process-focused praise. The main differences lie in how precisely they convey the original nuances and how naturally the simplified language flows.

Strengths: Uses appropriate B1-level vocabulary with clear simplifications like ""checks"" for ""analyses"" and ""does not last long"" for survival timeframe. Maintains all key scientific information accurately. The sentence structure is appropriately simplified while preserving meaning.

Weaknesses: The phrase ""releases thousands of tons of methane at once"" could be misinterpreted as simultaneous release rather than periodic emissions. Uses ""at once"" instead of ""at a time"" which slightly changes the meaning.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Provides the clearest explanation with ""making new methane"" which explicitly conveys the replenishment concept. Uses ""very long"" for emphasis which aids comprehension. Maintains accurate scientific content and appropriate B1 vocabulary level. Preserves ""at a time"" from the original text.

Weaknesses: Minor redundancy in repeating ""methane"" in the final sentence, though this may actually aid B1-level comprehension.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses natural contractions (""doesn't"") appropriate for B1 level. Maintains scientific accuracy and uses suitable vocabulary simplifications. Preserves the original meaning effectively.

Weaknesses: Like Model 1, uses ""at once"" instead of ""at a time,"" potentially creating confusion about the timing of methane emissions. The phrase ""making more of it"" is less clear than Model 2's ""making new methane.""

All three models successfully simplify complex scientific concepts for B1 level while maintaining factual accuracy. They appropriately replace ""periodically"" with ""regularly,"" ""analyses"" with ""checks,"" and simplify the description of methane's characteristics. The poetic final comparison about planetary breathing is preserved across all versions.

Strengths: Maintains accurate meaning throughout, uses appropriate B1-level vocabulary, and preserves the statistical information precisely. The sentence structure is clear and flows well.
Weaknesses: Minor issue with ""each"" addition after ""100,000 people"" which wasn't in the original, though this doesn't affect comprehension.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Good simplification of complex concepts, maintains factual accuracy, and uses accessible vocabulary. The restructuring of the murder rate information into two sentences improves clarity for B1 learners.
Weaknesses: Omits the word ""slightly"" when describing the decrease in murder rates, which removes a nuance from the original text.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very accessible language with phrases like ""getting along better,"" includes helpful additions like ""Also"" for better flow, and maintains statistical accuracy. The murder rate explanation is clear and well-structured.
Weaknesses: Changes ""From the end of World War II to 1990"" to ""After World War II until 1990,"" which slightly alters the temporal precision of the original statement.

All three models successfully adapt the text to B1 level by simplifying complex sentence structures and using more common vocabulary. They maintain the key statistical information and the overall argumentative structure of the original text. The differences between them are relatively minor, involving small word choices and structural adjustments.

Strengths: Maintains the original meaning well, uses appropriate B1-level vocabulary, and preserves the key message about combining passions. The phrase ""change from within"" effectively captures the original concept.
Weaknesses: ""Nothing lasting remains"" is slightly more complex than necessary for B1 level. The phrase ""doing the trick"" from the original is replaced with simpler language, which is appropriate for the level.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses clear, simple language appropriate for B1 level. The sentence structure is straightforward and accessible. Maintains all key information from the original text.
Weaknesses: ""With no mountains"" is less accurate than the original ""primarily flat country"" - Bangladesh does have some mountainous regions. The simplification loses some geographical nuance.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary and sentence structures. The phrase ""create its own solutions"" clearly conveys the self-reliance message. Maintains good flow and readability.
Weaknesses: The ending ""beginning to notice and respect what she is doing"" adds interpretation not present in the original text. The original focuses on attention and notice, not specifically respect.

**Key Differences:**
All three models successfully simplify the complex original text for B1 level. Model 1 retains more of the original's nuanced language, while Models 2 and 3 use simpler vocabulary. Model 2 has a geographical inaccuracy, and Model 3 adds interpretive content. All three handle the main narrative effectively, converting complex concepts into accessible language while maintaining the core message about Wasfia's dual approach to advocacy.

Additionally, six million fewer children die every year from disease, millions more girls are in school and millions of people have access to clean water.",qwen3-235b-a22b-2507,"Most people think poor countries are in bad shape: very poor, ruled by dictators, and with no real chance for change.

Also, six million fewer children die each year from illness, many more girls now go to school, and millions of people can drink clean water.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simple vocabulary appropriate for B1 level (""bad shape,"" ""earned more money,"" ""left poverty""). The sentence structure is clear and accessible. Successfully conveys all key statistical information.

Weaknesses: ""Left poverty"" is less natural than other alternatives. The phrase ""more girls go to school"" loses the emphasis on the significant increase implied in ""millions more girls.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains appropriate B1 vocabulary while being more precise (""extreme poverty,"" ""moved out of poverty""). The phrase ""many more girls now go to school"" better captures the scale of change. ""Can drink clean water"" is more natural than ""have access to clean water.""

Weaknesses: Minor inconsistency in maintaining the simplification level - some phrases could be slightly more complex than ideal for B1.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary and maintains clear sentence structure. ""Escaped poverty"" is a natural and accessible phrase. Like Model 2, uses ""many more girls now go to school"" and ""can drink clean water,"" which are effective simplifications.

Weaknesses: Very similar to Model 2 with minimal differentiation. ""Escaped poverty"" while natural, may be slightly less common than ""moved out of poverty.""

**Comparison:**
All three models successfully reduce the complexity of the original text and maintain the factual content. Models 2 and 3 are nearly identical, with the main difference being ""moved out of poverty"" versus ""escaped poverty."" Model 1 stands apart with ""left poverty"" and slightly less effective handling of the girls' education statistic. Models 2 and 3 both improve upon the water access phrasing by using ""can drink clean water"" instead of the more formal ""have access to clean water.""

Strengths: Maintains the core message accurately and uses appropriate B1-level vocabulary. The sentence structure is clear and accessible. Successfully conveys the concept without oversimplifying.
Weaknesses: Loses the explicit ""sandwich"" metaphor that helps B1 learners understand the concept more concretely. The phrase ""cushion criticism"" may still be slightly advanced for B1 level.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Explicitly includes the ""sandwich"" metaphor which aids comprehension for B1 learners. Uses simple, clear vocabulary throughout. Maintains the logical flow of the original argument effectively.
Weaknesses: The phrase ""hide the negative ones"" slightly changes the meaning from ""sugarcoating"" to concealment. Some repetition in sentence structure could be more varied.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Includes the helpful ""sandwich"" metaphor and uses accessible vocabulary. The word ""praise"" provides good variety and is appropriate for B1 level. Maintains clear logical progression.
Weaknesses: ""Sound better"" is less precise than the original concept of injecting positivity. The phrase ""feel less meaningful"" adds a subjective element not present in the original. ""Not only"" creates a slightly awkward construction in this context.

Strengths: Uses simpler vocabulary appropriate for B1 level (""crushing"" instead of ""stamping,"" ""almost no"" instead of ""very little""). The sentence structure is clear and accessible. Successfully maintains the core message while simplifying language.

Weaknesses: ""Automatic guns"" is less precise than the original ""gun turrets."" The phrase ""choose their own targets"" slightly changes the meaning from the original's emphasis on deciding ""who to kill.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains good vocabulary balance for B1 level. Preserves the Terminator reference which adds context. ""Automatic gun towers"" is a reasonable simplification of ""gun turrets."" The phrase ""dangerous for people"" uses simpler vocabulary than ""dangerous for humanity.""

Weaknesses: The sentence ""deciding on their own who to kill"" creates redundancy with the previous clause. The overall sentence structure in the middle paragraph becomes somewhat complex for B1 level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses clear, simple language throughout. ""I am part of"" is more straightforward than ""I'm a member of."" Explicitly states ""kill people"" which clarifies the action. ""Dangerous for humans"" maintains clarity while using accessible vocabulary.

Weaknesses: ""All by themselves"" at the end creates awkward phrasing and redundancy with ""on their own."" The sentence structure becomes unnecessarily complex with multiple clauses in the key explanatory sentence.

All three models successfully simplify the original text for B1 level readers while preserving the essential meaning. They appropriately reduce complex vocabulary and sentence structures. The main differences lie in word choice precision and sentence flow.

Strengths: Maintains clear sentence structure appropriate for B1 level. Successfully simplifies ""a good story or two"" to ""a good story"" while preserving meaning. Uses accessible vocabulary throughout.
Weaknesses: Changes ""housing estate with the highest crime rate"" to ""housing estate with high crime,"" losing the superlative emphasis. The phrase ""much more talkative"" is somewhat informal for the context.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Preserves the superlative ""highest crime rate"" from the original text. Maintains formal tone throughout. Clear paragraph structure with logical flow. Uses italics for the TV show title, showing attention to formatting.
Weaknesses: Slightly more complex sentence structures that may challenge B1 readers. The conjunction ""as well as"" adds complexity compared to simpler alternatives.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses ""writer"" instead of ""author,"" which is simpler vocabulary for B1 level. Creates dramatic emphasis with the dash and ""not quiet at all,"" making the contrast more vivid. Simplifies the location to ""part of Glasgow.""
Weaknesses: Oversimplifies ""housing estate with the highest crime rate"" to just ""part of Glasgow,"" losing important contextual information. The dramatic punctuation and phrasing may not align with typical B1 simplification goals.

**Ranking Assessment:**
Model 2 retains the most essential information while maintaining appropriate B1 accessibility. Model 1 provides good simplification but loses some key details. Model 3 oversimplifies important contextual elements despite using some simpler vocabulary choices.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level. Maintains factual accuracy throughout. The phrase ""flick tiny, irritating hairs"" is accessible and descriptive.

Weaknesses: Loses the specific term ""urticating hairs"" which provides scientific vocabulary. The phrase ""up the wrong way"" from the original is completely omitted, removing some of the original's character.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Retains good factual accuracy and uses appropriate B1 vocabulary. The phrase ""shooting tiny, irritating hairs into the air"" effectively conveys the defensive mechanism. Maintains the scientific concept of paralysis.

Weaknesses: Uses ""about 25 kinds"" instead of the precise ""25 kinds,"" introducing unnecessary approximation. The idiomatic expression ""up the wrong way"" is not addressed.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very accessible language with ""it usually just hurts a little"" which is natural for B1 level. Maintains scientific accuracy about the anti-venom date and spider behavior.

Weaknesses: Significantly simplifies ""spider bites can be painful"" to ""just hurts a little,"" which understates the original meaning. Changes the precise ""25 kinds"" to maintain the exact number but loses some nuance in the pain description.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three models successfully adapt the text to B1 level by simplifying complex vocabulary and sentence structures. They maintain the key factual information about spider venom, the 25 dangerous species, and the Sydney funnel-web spider. Each model handles the technical concept of urticating hairs differently, with varying degrees of scientific precision versus accessibility.

The main differences lie in how each model balances scientific accuracy with linguistic simplification, and how they handle specific details like exact numbers versus approximations.

Based on these reasons, we will give suggestions to improve the work experience and help keep more employees at the company.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains professional tone while simplifying vocabulary. ""Industry average"" is clear and appropriate for B1 level. The structure closely follows the original while using accessible language.
Weaknesses: ""Based on these findings"" introduces terminology not present in the original and may be slightly advanced for B1. The phrase ""look into the reasons behind employee engagement"" could be clearer about what aspect of engagement is being investigated.

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses very clear, simple language throughout. ""Feel engaged or not at work"" makes the concept of employee engagement concrete and understandable. The addition of ""we will suggest"" makes the text more direct and personal.
Weaknesses: ""This may not sound like much"" is less precise than the original's acknowledgment that it might not seem high. The phrase ""why employees feel engaged or not"" oversimplifies the investigation focus, which was specifically about causes of engagement issues.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: ""How involved employees feel at work"" provides a clear explanation of employee engagement using simpler vocabulary. ""The usual rate"" is accessible language for B1 learners. Maintains the logical flow of the original text.
Weaknesses: ""Look at the reasons behind how involved employees feel"" creates awkward phrasing that could confuse readers. The sentence structure becomes unnecessarily complex in the middle section.

**Overall Assessment:**
All three models successfully reduce vocabulary complexity and maintain the core meaning. Model 1 preserves the most professional tone while remaining accessible. Model 2 achieves the greatest simplification but loses some precision. Model 3 provides good vocabulary choices but suffers from unclear sentence construction in key areas.

119-b1,"So much of what the speaker said rang true. I honestly believe there's a danger that the more connected we are, the more isolated we feel. I don't think this is such an issue for my generation who've lived without technology for so long. We know how to be alone and, more importantly, we know that it's OK to be alone. But the under 20s are another kettle of fish. They're so busy communicating that they never experience the feeling of solitude and run the risk of not learning how to enjoy their own company. In addition, they're learning conversation through messages that can be edited and changed at the expense of learning the art of real conversation in real time with the person in front of you.",qwen3-235b-a22b-2507,"Much of what the speaker said felt true.

Strengths: Uses simple, clear language appropriate for B1 level. Successfully simplifies ""rang true"" to ""felt true"" and ""another kettle of fish"" to ""are different."" Maintains the core meaning while making it accessible.

Weaknesses: Loses some nuance by omitting ""honestly believe"" and simplifying ""run the risk of not learning"" to ""might never learn."" The phrase ""live conversations"" is slightly awkward - ""real conversations"" would be clearer.

**Model 2 Analysis:**

Strengths: Provides clear explanations and maintains good flow. Uses appropriate B1 vocabulary while preserving most of the original meaning. The phrase ""in the moment"" effectively captures ""real time.""

Weaknesses: Changes ""rang true"" to ""felt true"" which slightly alters the meaning. Uses ""rewrite"" in addition to ""edit"" which may be unnecessarily repetitive for B1 learners.

**Model 3 Analysis:**

Strengths: Maintains very close fidelity to the original text while using B1-appropriate language. Successfully preserves ""in real time"" and keeps the structure parallel to the original. Adds helpful clarification with ""online"" to explain the type of connection.

Weaknesses: ""A lot of what the speaker said was true"" is less precise than the original ""rang true."" Minor redundancy in ""edit and change"" though this mirrors the original text.

All three translations successfully adapt the complex original text to B1 level by simplifying vocabulary and sentence structures. They eliminate the idiomatic expression ""another kettle of fish"" and make the concepts more accessible to intermediate learners.

120-b1,"Don't always follow positive feedback with negative feedback. When positive and negative feedback always appear to go hand in hand, the positives can become devalued and ignored. Ensure there are times when positive feedback is given for its own sake and resist the temptation to offer constructive criticism.",qwen3-235b-a22b-2507,"Don’t always give negative feedback after positive feedback.

If they always come together, people might start to ignore the positive comments. Make sure to give praise on its own sometimes, and avoid adding criticism every time.","**Model 1 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses simpler vocabulary appropriate for B1 level (""praise"" instead of ""positive feedback,"" ""adding"" instead of ""offer""). The sentence structure is clear and straightforward. Successfully conveys the main message about not pairing positive and negative feedback.

Weaknesses: Loses the concept of ""constructive criticism"" from the original, which is replaced with just ""criticism."" The phrase ""seem less important"" is somewhat weaker than ""devalued"" in conveying the impact. Missing the idea that feedback should be given ""for its own sake.""

**Model 2 Analysis:**
Strengths: Maintains the concept of constructive criticism by adding ""even if it's meant to be helpful,"" which preserves the original meaning. Uses B1-appropriate vocabulary while keeping the core message intact. The structure flows logically from problem to solution.

Weaknesses: Slightly longer than necessary for B1 level. The phrase ""meant to be helpful"" adds length without significantly improving clarity for the target level.

**Model 3 Analysis:**
Strengths: Uses clear, simple language suitable for B1 level. The phrase ""every time"" effectively conveys the frequency issue mentioned in the original. Good use of ""make sure to"" which is common at B1 level.

Weaknesses: Does not address the concept of constructive criticism or helpful intent behind negative feedback. The ending feels somewhat abrupt compared to the original's more complete explanation.

**Overall Comparison:**
All three models successfully simplify the vocabulary and sentence structure for B1 level. Model 2 best preserves the nuanced meaning of the original text, particularly regarding constructive criticism. Model 1 provides the clearest simplification but loses some meaning. Model 3 offers good clarity but omits important conceptual elements.
